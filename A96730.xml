            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are a few things (courteous Reader) of which I would not have them ignorant who ſhall chance to peruſe this ſhort Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie; whereof ſome concern the Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> whoſe Actions in his Country for two years ſpace are here publiſhed; and others have relation to the Author of this work. And firſt of all I deſire thee to take notice, that <hi>Montroſe</hi> is the Chief of that antient and famous Family of the <hi>Grahams,</hi> and is called in old Scotiſh <hi>Graham more,</hi> the great <hi>Graham.</hi> He derives his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree from that famous
<hi>Graham,</hi> in the Hiſtories of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was ſon-in-law to <hi>Fergus</hi> the ſecond King of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and was the firſt (that with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his father-in-law) caſt down that Trench which <hi>Severus</hi> had made, and ſet out for the utmoſt limit of the Roman Empire, between the Scotiſh <hi>Frith</hi> and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of
<hi>Cluid,</hi> at ſuch a place where Great <hi>Britain</hi> was narrowest; and by that means cut the power of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſhorter. Whence it happens, that ſome evident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of that Trench retain his name amongſt the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to this day, who call it <hi>Gremeſdike.</hi> The ſame
<hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> from whom this noble Family took its riſe, ſurviving his father-in-law <hi>Forgus,</hi> and being a man as able for Civill as Military employment, was made Protector unto
<pb facs="tcp:116000:4"/> his Nephew, and Regent of the Kingdome; and after he had fetched back the Doctors of the Chriſtian Faith, who had been vaniſhed by the late wars, and ſetled as well the Church as State with excellent Laws, freely reſigned the Government into the hands of his Nephew when he came to age. He flouriſhed in the time of the Emperours <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and
<hi>Honorius,</hi> about the year of our Lord <hi>CCCC.</hi> From whom hath deſcended in a fair and ſtraight line, a long and noble row of Poſterity, who, imitating the vertue of their Anceſtors, have been famous in the ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. Amongſt whom that valiant <hi>Graham</hi> was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, who with the help of <hi>Dumbarre,</hi> ſo ſeaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued his Country from the <hi>Danes,</hi> who were then Maſters of
<hi>England;</hi> and had frequently, but with little ſucceſſe invaded
<hi>Scotland</hi> with mighty Armies. And in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that noble <hi>John Graham</hi> came nothing behind his Anceſtors in vertue and honour, who after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, in that vacation of the Kingdome, while <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Bailiol</hi> diſputed their titles, was (with that renowned Vice-roy <hi>William Walley)</hi> a ſtout main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of his Countries Liberty againſt the unjuſt oppreſſion and tyranny of
<hi>Edward,</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> and after many heroicall exploits, fighting valiantly for his Nation, dyed in the bed of Honour. His Tomb is yet to be ſeen in a Chappell which hath the name of <hi>Folkirk,</hi> from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Gremeſdike,</hi> by which it ſtands. Adjoyning unto which the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe</hi> hath large and plentifull poſſeſſions, deſcended by inheritance unto him from that firſt
<hi>Graham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould ſeem to derive the Nobility of ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious a worthies extraxion only out of the rubbiſh of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and obſcure Antiquity; I muſt not omit that his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the Earl of
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> was advanced unto places of the greateſt honour in that Kingdome, and diſcharged them moſt happily. For, being Lord Chancellour of
<hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at ſuch time as King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, of bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:116000:4"/> memory came to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> he was created by him Vice-roy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and enjoyed that higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which a Subject is capable of, with the love and good affection both of King and People to the day of his death. And his Father was a man of ſingular indowments both of body and mind, and ſo known to be both in Forraign Countries and at home: who after he had performed many moſt honourable Embaſſages for King <hi>James,</hi> was called to be Lord Preſident of the Seſſion by King <hi>Charles:</hi> and being ſnatched away from his Countrey and all good men, by an untimely death, was extremely lamented and miſſed. And what we may think or hope of the grandchild, I leave unto thee to judge by what he hath done already, ſeeing he is yet (now a year and a half after his employment in his Country) ſcarce entred upon the 36. year of year of his age.</p>
            <p>One thing more I muſt adde for thy ſake (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:) three Periods already have been very dangerous and almoſt fatall to the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland:</hi> the first by the oppreſſion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe yoke our Anceſtors caſt off by the Conduct of that first
<hi>Graham</hi> deſcended of the noble <hi>Britiſh</hi> Family of the
<hi>Fulgentii.</hi> The ſecond by the <hi>Danes,</hi> therepulſe of whom is owing, eſpecially to the the proweſſe of the ſecond <hi>Graham</hi> aforeſaid. And the third by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> whom the third <hi>Graham</hi> twice expelled out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and gave them many and great defeats. So that (as it was of old ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the
<hi>Scipioes</hi> in <hi>Africk)</hi> it ſeems the name of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is ſomething fatall to their enemies, and lucky to their country at a dead lift; and that it was not without the ſpeciall providence of God Almighty, that in theſe worſt times One ſtood up who did his beſt endeavours to maintain the Kings juſt Rights and Authority, the Peace, Safety, and Liberty of the Subjects, and the Honour and antient ſplendour of his Houſe. And this is all I thought good at this time to premiſe concerning the Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:116000:5"/> And for the Author of the Book take it briefly thus. Hee profeſſeth himſelf to have been but little converſant in theſe ſort of ſtudies, and expecteth neither credit or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for the ſtrength of his wit (which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be little or none,) nor reward or profit for his Pains; which two things are the chiefeſt incentives to moſt to Wet their pen; but that he undertook the buſineſſe meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of a deſire to propagate the truth to other Nations, and to poſterity. For hee ſaw by late and lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in ſuch a Cauſe as this, that proſperous Villany can find more Advocates than down-caſt Truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For when the ſame Confederates in both Kingdomes had by their own arts, (that is, by lying and ſlandering) ruined the Church, to fill their bags with its Revenues ſo ſacrilegiouſly purloyned, and enrich their poſterity with plentifull <hi>Anathema's</hi> and accurſed things; there wanted no ſtore of men that extolled them for it to the skies, as men deſerving highly from their Country, from the Church it ſelf, and from all man-kind: and reviled with all ſort of reproaches and contumelies the moſt religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, holy Martyrs and Confeſſors, for withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. And therefore he might well imagine, that theſe men, who by the ſame deviſes laboured to render his Majeſtie himſelf odious, and ſo to deſtroy Him, to enjoy his Honours and Revenues ſo traiterouſly and perfidiouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyned; would eaſily find men who ſhould out of the like rayling humour beſpatter as much as in them lay this moſt excellent man, and all his honourable atchievements; and (as it is ſaid of Waſps) poyſon with their tongues or pens the juice of moſt ſweet and wholſome flowers, and leave the leſſe knowing, or leſſe wary, to ſuck it up. He was therefore pleaſed to offer this ſhort and faithfull Narrative, as a ſeaſonable antidote againſt that evill, to all that loved truth and plain dealing: of which he would needs be ſo obſtinate a maintainer, that although he ſaw
<pb facs="tcp:116000:5"/> well enough how much envie and hatred it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive upon himſelf, hee reſolved he would neither baſely ſlatter any one, nor lap up that truth which they would not like to bear in obſcure and doubtfull Expreſſions, For hee profeſſes, that as he is a Free-man born and bred, ſo he will never part with his Freedome till with his life. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be ambitious of no other commendable quality of a good Hiſtorian, neither of wit, nor art, nor eloquence, yet he ſeems to challenge in his own right the honour of ſincere and exact truth: for the defence and propagation whereof he hath ſet at nought all that was dear in this world, having been thrice plundered of all that he had, thrice impriſoned in a naſty and filthy Jail, and now the third time lives in baniſhment for the Truths ſake. Yet he is merry and chearfull, that being conſcious to himſelf of no wrong, as towards men, he is counted worthy of the Lord to ſuffer theſe things for truths and righteouſneſſe ſake. And thou (good Reader) make much of him at leaſt for his truths ſake; excuſe him for other things, and farewell.</p>

They pretended to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then, leſſe than the preſervation of Religion, the Honour and Dignitie of the King, the Lawes of the Land, and the freedome of that antient Realm, ſo happily, ſo valiantly defended in time of yore from ſuch powerfull enemies, as the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes, Normans,</hi> by the ſweat and blood, with the lives and eſtates of their Anceſtors. And the tales they made, they never wanted fitting inſtruments to tell and ſpread among the people. It was given out, that there was nothing more in the aim of the Court of <hi>England,</hi> than that that free people being reduced to a kind of Province ſhould be eternally enſlaved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of their old enemies. Yet all this while
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116000:7"/> they, engaged themſelves by their publike atteſtations, and even a ſolemn Oath, that they would never goe to work by force and arms, nor ſollicite the King any other way than by Petition, That he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed graciouſly to accept the ſupplications of his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Subjects, and to take order that his deareſt Country ſhould ſuffer nothing in matter of Religion, or the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>But at laſt in the year 1639. <hi>Montroſe</hi> found out that theſe fair tales were coyn'd of purpoſe to ſteal the hearts of the ſilly and ſuperſtitious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to alienate them from the King, as an enemie to Religion and Libertie. For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters did not diſſemble to him, but ſpoke out, that <hi>Scotland</hi> had been too long governed by Kings, nor could it ever be well with them, as long as one
<hi>Stuart</hi> (that's the ſirname of the Kings family in <hi>Scotland)</hi> was alive: and in the extirpation of them, they were firſt to ſtrike at the head; ſo that <hi>Montroſe</hi> eaſily perceived the Kings Majeſtie and Perſon was levelled at. Therefore vehemently deteſting ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a crime, he reſolved to deſert the Conſpirators ſide, to fruſtrate their counſells, to impoveriſh their ſtore, to weaken their ſtrength, and with all his might to preſerve his Majeſty and His Authority entire, and inviolate. But becauſe between force and craft, the Covenanters had drawn in almoſt all the Kingdome to their ſide, he ſaw himſelf alone too weak to check their power, and therefore thought not good to open himſelf too ſuddenly or raſhly. Amongſt them he had many friends, men very conſiderable, as well in regard of their numerous retinues and clients, as of their wealth and authoritie: theſe he had a mind to draw oft from them, and bring them with him to the King; and by this means conceived he ſhould be able to gather no ſmall power, which would conduce
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116000:7"/> much both to the Kings ſafetie and his own.</p>
            <p>Mean time the Covenanters raiſe a ſtrong Army againſt the King, and in a ſolemn Convention at <hi>Duns,</hi> they determine to invade
<hi>England: Montroſe</hi> was abſent then. Which reſolution of theirs, the chief of the Covenanters had taken up in their cabinet counſels more than ſix weeks before; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had been buſie in divulging through all Great <hi>Britain</hi> their Apologeticall Pamphlets, whereby they laboured to ſet a good gloſſe upon the reaſons of their Expedition. This reſolution of theirs, <hi>Montroſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned, ſeeing hee could hinder, would not ſeem to diſapprove: <hi>Montroſe</hi> commanded in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my two thouſand Foot, and five hundred horſe, his friends (who were moſt obliged unto him, and had religiouſly promiſed their beſt endeavours in the Kings ſervice) had the command of five thouſand more. And truly if a great part of them had not been worſe than their words, they had either brought the whole Army along with them to the King, or at leaſt had broken the neck of the Covenanters deſigns. When the Army came to the river of <hi>Tweed</hi> (which is the border of the two Kingdomes) dice were caſt amongſt the Noblemen and Commanders, and it was <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s chance to paſſe firſt over the river; which he cheerfully performed on his feer, his own foot Souldiers following him, that he might more eaſily conceal his own reſolution, and take off all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuſpition. For as well his authority in the Army, as the integrity of his noble ſpirit began to be looked on with a jealous eie, by the guilty-conſcienced Rebells, ſo that they diligently obſerved all his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, words and deeds.</p>
            <p>After this, marching over the river of <hi>Tine</hi> four miles above <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> by the treacherie of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Commanders who had retreated to <hi>York</hi> with a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116000:8"/> potent Army of the Kings, the Scors poſſeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that Town: and thereupon, Commiſſioners being appointed on either ſide to treat of a Peace, a Truce was preſently made. In the time of this Truce, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſent Letters unto the King, profeſſing his fidelity, and moſt dutifull and ready obedience to his Majeſty; nor did the Letters contain any thing elſe. Theſe being ſtoln away in the night, and copied out by the Kings own Bed-chamber-men, men moſt endeared to the King of all the world, were ſent back by them to the Covenanters at <hi>Newcastle:</hi> and it was the faſhion with thoſe very men to communicate unto the Covenanters from day to day the Kings moſt ſecret Counſels, of which they themſelves only were either authors or partakers. And ſome of the forwarder ſort of the Rebels were not aſhamed to tax <hi>Montroſe</hi> bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough with thoſe Letters: and although they durſt not make an open quarrell of it, or call him publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to account, becauſe he was ſo powerfull and welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in the Army, yet they loaded him with backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and ſlanders among the people. For they had obliged unto themſelves moſt of the Preachers throughout the Kingdome, whoſe mercenary tongues they made uſe of to wind and turn the minds of the people which way they would. Nor did they promote their Rebellion more effectually any other way, nor doe yet, than this, to have thoſe doughty Oratours in their popular preachments to rail bitterly againſt the King and all his Loyall Subjects, as the <hi>enemies of Chriſt</hi> (as they love to ſpeak) being themſelves the while the very ſhame and ſcandall of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montroſe</hi> returning into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thinking of nothing but how to preſerve his Majeſtie from that ſtorm of Rebellion hanging over his head, at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of this courſe. He joyns many of the prime men for Nobility and Power, in a League with himſelf, in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116000:8"/> which they vowed to defend the Kings Majeſty, and all his Royall Privileges, and antient and lawfull Prerogatives, with the hazard of their lives and eſtates, againſt all his enemies, as well home-bred, as forraign, unto the laſt breath in their bodies. And truly it came to that paſſe, that there had been an open diviſion in the Army (which was his aim) had not ſome for fear, levity, or cowardife (which are bad keepers of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell) betrayed the whole buſineſſe to the Covenanters. Hence aroſe no ſmall ſtirs and brauls, but were paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied again in a while; for neither yet durſt they offer any open violence to
<hi>Montroſe.</hi> But afterward the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates having given a new oath, made ſure the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at their devotion; and joyning themſelves to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in a ſtrict Covenant, although they ſaw themſelves ſecure enough from the ſubtleſt deſigns of any private man, yet they seriouſly conſult how they ſhould take <hi>Montroſe</hi> out of the way, whoſe heroick ſpirit being fixt on high and honourable (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever difficult) at chievements, they could not endure.</p>
            <p>To make their way therefore unto ſo villanous an act, by the aſſiſtance of ſome Courtiers whom with gifts and promiſes they had corrupted, they underſtood that the King had written Letters to
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> and that they were quilted in the ſaddle of the bearer, one <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> belonging to the Earl of <hi>Traquair.</hi> The bearer was ſcarce entered the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, rip his ſaddle, and find the Letters. There was nothing at all written in them, which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the beſt of Kings to command, the beſt of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey. Nevertheleſſe thoſe moſt exact crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters in the arts of Lying and Slandering, ſet about horrible and tragicall reports by their apt Miniſters, that at laſt all the Kings plots with <hi>Montroſe,</hi> for the overthrow of Religion, and the ruine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were found out and diſcovered. Nor yet neither
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116000:9"/> durſt they afford him a publike tryall, but on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den when he ſuſpected nothing, thruſt him (with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi> Lord of <hi>Marchiſton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Sterling Keer</hi> Knight, two, both of his neer kindred, and intimate familiars) into the caſtle of
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length a Pacification being made between the people of both Kingdomes, (between whom there had been no War, only they laid their heads together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their moſt juſt and gracious King) a Parliament was called at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the King in perſon was preſent.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> deſires moſt earneſtly to be tryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and that ſolemn Aſſembly; but to no purpoſe, for the Covenanters being conſcious enough of his innocency, and their own guilt, applyed their ſpeciall endeavours to detain the Gentlemen in priſon unheard, untill ſuch time as the King was gone out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and they had concluded all things with the King in Parliament according to their hearts deſire. And certainly they were much afraid, leſt by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and courage, and the eſteem he was in, as well with his Peers of the Nobility, as with the people, he ſhould have fetch'd off the greateſt number of either ſort to his own reſolution, for the preſervation of his Majeſties Power and Authority. At laſt the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>England, Montroſe</hi> and his friends are ſet at liberty: and becauſe it was ordered in Parliament, that he ſhould not come into conference with the King, he ſat ſtill awhile at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Chap. II.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1642. the Covenanters of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes began to unmask themſelves, and let us ſee more plainly what they meant to doe. The Rebels in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116000:9"/> 
                  <hi>England</hi> began to vex the King with unjuſt, unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, unſeaſonable Petitions and Complaints; beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with malicious ſlanders; prophane his ſacred Name in ſcurrilous ſongs and Ballads; vilifie him in infamous Libells, Paſquills, or Pamphlets; raiſe Tumults, arm great numbers of the ſcum and raſcally ſort of the people, and engage them upon the Kings Palace; in a word, threaten all extremity to him and his: whom although he might have juſtly puniſhed himſelf, yet he choſe rather to refer them to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that he might the more oblige it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But it was to no end for ſo gracious a King, to gratifie that and many things more, to ſo ungracious, ſo ingratefull men, who were the very authors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors of theſe villanies. For he had already granted more and greater Graces to his Subjects, for the eaſe of their grievances (which they pretended) and the ſecurity of their perſons and eſtates, than all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> together, from <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour downward. Therefore at laſt, that he might withdraw himſelf and his family from preſent danger, he is forced ſore againſt his mind to depart
<hi>London:</hi> He ſends the Queen out of the way into <hi>Holland</hi> for the ſafety of her life, and betakes himſelf to <hi>York.</hi> The States of Parliament (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) forthwith, and before the King, take up arms, and divert thoſe very Forces which the King had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which were then in a readineſs. and whoſe Officers had been of the Parliaments choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, hoping by them to overthrow the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Rebells in <hi>Scotland</hi> who knew well enough the King would have ſtrength ſufficient to deal with the Engliſh Rebells, reſolved upon no termes to be wanting to their confederates in ſo apparent danger as they were. And although our moſt gracious King had given them ſatisfaction (as much as ever they

                  </gap>) in that Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which alſo they have recorded among their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Acts, nevertheleſſe they provide thmſelves for a march into
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that they might the better ſecure their affairs at home, they labour tooth and nail to draw <hi>Montroſe</hi> (of whom almoſt only they were afraid) again to their ſide. They offer him of their own accord the office of Lieutenant-Generall in the Army, and what ever elſe he could deſire, and they beſtow. He ſeeing a mighty ſtorm hovering over the Kings head, that he might give him an account of it, whereby it might be timely prevented, undertakes a journey into <hi>England,</hi> taking the Lord
<hi>Ogleby</hi> into his counſell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> he receives news that the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly returned out of <hi>Holland,</hi> was landed at <hi>Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> in
<hi>York-ſhire:</hi> thither he makes haſte, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates unto the Queen all things in order. She, having had a rough paſſage, and being not well recovered from the diſtempers at Sea, told him ſhe would adviſe further with him about that buſineſſe after they came to <hi>York.</hi> Thither being come, the Queen of her own accord calls for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> he opens the whole ſtory over again, and makes it appear, that there was no leſſe danger from the Scotch, than from the Engliſh Covenanters, if they were not timely ſuppreſſed. And being asked his opinion what was beſt to be done, anſwered; <hi>To reſiſt force with force,</hi> told her, <hi>the King wanted not Subjects in</hi> Scotland, <hi>faithfull men, and ſtout; nor did they want hearts, or wealth, or power to oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the covenanters, if they durſt enterpriſe any thing againſt the King: all that they wanted was the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, without which they durſt doe nothing, with which any thing; and all the danger that was, was in delay: That the Covenanters, when they had once got their Army
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116000:10"/> one foot would be able to grind any one to pieces that ſhould offer to stir; therefore the beginnings of ſo great an evill were to be withſtood, and the Cockatrice bruiſed in the egge; that phyſick being too late that comes when the diſeaſe hath over-run the whole body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wholſome counſell it was, and ſeaſonable, which doubtleſſe the moſt prudent Queen had approved of. But while things were going on in ſo good a poſture, all things were quaſh'd by the comming of the Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon pretence of kiſſing the Queens hand, and gratulating her happy return, but in very deed that he might overthrow <hi>Montroſe</hi> his counſells; for he had poſted thither with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſent of the Covenanters. Nor did hee himſelf diſſemble that there was ſome danger from the Scotiſh Covenanters; but he laboured to extenuate it, and condemned the counſell of
<hi>Montroſe</hi> as raſh, unadviſed and unſeaſonable. <hi>That ſtout and warlike Nation was not to be reduced with force and arms, but with gentleneſſe and courteſies. Warre, eſpecially Civill War, ſhould be the last remedy, and uſed many times to be repented of even by the Conquerours. The fortune of Warre was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; if the King ſhould get the beſt, it would be but a ſorry triumph he could enjoy over his own Subjects: but if he had the worſt on't, he muſt expect what his ſoul</hi> (good man) <hi>abhorred to ſpeak. All means were to be tryed to preſerve peace with that Nation, nor were things yet come to that paſſe, that the King ſhould deſpair of amity and reconciliation with them: Hee would bee ready to take the whole buſineſſe upon himſelfe, if the King pleaſed to commit it to his pains and truſt, and to authoriſe him ſufficiently thereunto.</hi> Montroſe replyed, <hi>nothing would come of that, but the delay of time, untill the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors having raiſed an Army ſhould prevent the King of any means to deliver himſelf and his party from their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi> The ſad event proved all this to be too true;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116000:11"/> but in this debate <hi>Montroſe</hi> was fain to ſuffer himſelf to be overborn, being not ſo great a Courtier as the other; nor were thoſe vertues; which the world now admires, diſcovered then unto the Queen. <hi>Hamilton</hi> returning into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeemed to be as Active for the King a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was poſſible.</p>
               <p>The Covenanters mean-while by their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (contrary to the known Lawes of the Kingdome) ſummon a Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> which all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men that wiſhed well unto the King, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would be of very dangerous conſequence to his affairs, and therefore abhorred it ſo much, that they intended not to honour it with their preſence. But
<hi>Hamilton</hi> interpoſing the name and authority of the King, invited them by his Letters, that they would not fail to be all there; and that they ſhould not doubt but they would be able to out-vote the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, if at this time they were not wanting to the Kings cauſe. And if it ſhould happen otherwiſe, hee would be ready with his friends, to proteſt againſt the Covenanters, and immediatly to leave them. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Nobility incited by the name of the King and thoſe hopes, were preſent at that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only <hi>Montroſe</hi> and a few of his adherents ſtaid away. And with
<hi>Montroſe</hi> too, the Duke had dealt by his friends, that as he loved and honoured the King, he would joyn himſelf unto them. But he (who bad reaſon to ſuſpect all motions that came that way) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he was ready to grapple with any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſpecially under his command who had ſo great as honour as to be the Kings ſupream Commiſſioner; only on this condition, that the Duke ſhould engage his honour, that if they could not bring up that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to righteous things, he would endeavour to enforce them by the dint of the ſword. He anſwered, he would proteſt, he would not fight. Which paſſage
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116000:11"/> conſidered, <hi>Montroſe</hi> to preſerve his integrity, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſſue, betook himſelf to his own home.</p>
               <p>In that Parliament, the Covenanters out-voted the Loyall party by ſeventy voyces or thereabouts, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon the Royall authority, arrogated unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the power of calling of Parliaments, preſſing Souldiers, ſending Embaſſadours, and other things hitherto unattempted, without the Kings knowledge or conſent. And to make up the meaſure of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and treaſon, ordain that a powerfull Army ſhall be raiſed againſt the King, and in the aid of their confederates of <hi>England.</hi> To which purpoſe they tax the people with new Subſidies and Levies, much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, then if all the Impoſitions which upon never ſo much neceſſity for two thouſand years ſpace by one hundred and nine Kings have been charged upon them, were put together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore, who ſaw the King was like to be ruined by his own authority, and ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> too, that he was too weak to oppoſe hmſelf both againſt the ſtrength of the Covenanters, and the Kings abuſed Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a melancholy mood, made as if he took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing. And the Covenanters, ſuppoſing that he had received ſome diſtaſte from the King, by reaſon of the affront he received at <hi>York,</hi> and
<hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s over-powring him, they ſet upon him yet again, privately and by friends, to ſee if by intreaty or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt they could draw him to their ſide; offering him authority and wealth, even the greateſt Honour Civill and Military. Which offers he did not ſeem much to ſlight, that by that means he might have an eaſier way to dive into their counſels. The Covenanters, that this growing friendſhip might be the better cemented and ſanctified (God bleſſe us) ſend unto him that great Apoſtle of their Covenant, <hi>Alexander Henderſon,</hi> who ſhould give him full ſatisfaction in all his ſcruples.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116000:12"/> 
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> heartily deſired to ſpeak with that fellow, out of whom he doubted not to pump all the ſecrets of the Covenanters: and leſt a private meeting with ſuch a man ſhould give a ſcandall to the Kings friends, he took the Lords <hi>Napier</hi> and
<hi>Ogleby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Sterling Keere,</hi> to be witneſſes of the diſcourſe, and on the bank of the river <hi>Forth</hi> not far from
<hi>Sterling</hi> they met.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> made as though he accounted himſelf very happy, and much honoured in the viſit of ſo worthy a man, upon whoſe faith, honeſty, and judgement, he ſo much relyed. Told him, <hi>That to give the ill opinion of his enemies leave to breath it ſelf after ſome late mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, he was content to ſtay at home; that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what was done in Parliament; that he was almoſt at loſſe how to behave himſelf in that tickliſh Condition the Common wealth ſtood; and therefore beſeeched him for old acquaintance ſake to let him freely know what they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Henderſon</hi> taking it for granted by theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he was wheeling about towards the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, that he might the more oblige the Marqueſſe unto him, anſwered him flatly and without more adoe,
<hi>That it was reſolved to ſend as ſtrong an Army as they could raiſe, in aid of their brethren of</hi> England <hi>againſt the Kings forces; that the Covenanters of both Kingdomes had unanimouſly agreed upon this, either to dye or bring the King to their lure; that nothing could fall out more happily, than that he ſhould renew his friendſhip with his Peers of the Nobility, and the reſt of the Kingdome; that ſo doing he would give great content to all men, beſides the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit that would redound to himſelf; that by his example others (if others there were that idolized the empty ſhadow of the Kings name,) would joyn themſelves unto the Covenanters; and for his own part he would give moſt bearty thanks unto his Lord God, that he had vouchſafed to make uſe of him as the Miniſter and ever Mediatour of ſo great a work;</hi> and at laſt entreated him to <hi>ſpeak out
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116000:12"/> his mind, and commit all ſuch things to his care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie as he ſhould deſire from the Parliament, either in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his honour or profit; aſſuring him he ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to his hearts deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> having gotten out the knowledge of thoſe things which he eagerly ſought for, now bethought himſelf how he ſhould keep <hi>Henderſon</hi> and his party in ſuſpence awhile, that they ſhould not yet get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. For what anſwer could he give them? If he ſhould profeſſe himſelf to be againſt their courſes, that would do the King no good, and might bring a great deal of danger upon himſelf: and on the other ſide, to put them in greater hopes of him, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe things he never meant to perform, he ſcorned, as being a ſtain unto his honour. Therefore he takes this courſe; there was preſent at that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <hi>Henderſon</hi> one Sir <hi>James Rollock,</hi> Chief of a very antient and flouriſhing Family; his former wife had been

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116000:14"/> Loyalty to fight againſt him, and given up unto the Rebells, now that they had got an Army, all that they had without ſtriking a ſtroke.

<hi>John Cockeram</hi> his Embaſſadour about it with his Commiſſion and Inſtructions. And directions unto the Marqueſſe of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> were carried by ſome of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s own company. Who receiving the Kings
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116000:15"/> Letters and Commiſſion to be Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Generall of the Army there, made himſelf ready for his journey. In the interim news comes on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that Duke
<hi>Hamilton</hi> with his brother the Earl of <hi>Lannerick</hi> were poſting up to <hi>Oxford.</hi> They, that they might make their acceſſe eaſier to the king, who had hitherto given eare unto their counſells, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue or recover the good opinion the King had of them, gave out all the way as they came, eſpecially unto Governours of Shires and Towns, and Commanders of the Army, that they were baniſhed their Country, that they had been plundered of their eſtates by the Covenanters for their loyaltie to the King, and that for ſafety of their lives, with which they had hardly eſcaped, they fled to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But <hi>Montroſe</hi> and thoſe of his mind ſaw plainly that theſe were but tales of their own making, of purpoſe to wipe off the ſuſpition of this new guilt; and that by this means, they in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that eſteem they had lately with the King, and of a ſtrong faction they drove at Court, doubted not but they ſhould ſtand as fair in his opinion as ever, if they were but once admitted into the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and that the only buſineſſe they had thither, was by defeating <hi>Montroſe</hi> again, clearly to extinguiſh that little ſpark of Loyalty that was not yet quite out in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And
<hi>Montroſe</hi> delivered himſelf freely that for his part he would never ſtand by to be witneſſe of ſo great

The King was drawn with much adoe, that they ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the Court, yet for all that he ſuffered the Earl of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116000:16"/> 
                  <hi>Lanerick</hi> to live in the City. But he (by whoſe inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I cannot tell) betakes himſelf from
<hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Scotch Army which had now entered <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and never ſince hath failed to do them the beſt ſervice he could. The eſcape of his brother ſo much moved the King, that he ſaw it high time to ſecure the Duke himſelf.</p>
               <p>There were ſeverall Scots in the Kings court and Army who were ſuſpected (and perhaps not without reaſon) to favour the Covenanters too much, and to give intelligence unto them of the Kings counſels.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> that he might put theſe to the touch, took this courſe, He got a Proteſtation to be drawn up by the Kings authority, unto which all Scots who would have the reputation of honeſt men were to ſet their hands: Wherein <hi>they profeſſed themſelves heartily to deteſt the courſes of the Covenanters; condemned eſpecially the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of an Army into</hi> England, <hi>againſt the King and the Lawes of the Land, as an act of high treaſon; promiſed and vowed to acquit themſelves of that ſcandall; and to the utmoſt of their power, with the hazard of their lives and fortunes, to oppoſe thoſe that were guilty of that crime.</hi> This Proteſtation all men of honour and honeſty readily took; but there were two, in whom the King truſted moſt of all Scotch-men next to the
<hi>Hamiltons,</hi> to wit, the Earl of <hi>Trequaire,</hi> and Maſter
<hi>William Murray</hi> of the Bed-chamber, who were difficultly brought into it at laſt, with much reluctancy and fear of being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red traitours: yet even they engaged themſelves by a ſolemn Oath at a certain day to be aiding and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Montroſe</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Oath of theirs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they moſt unworthily violated.</p>
               <p>This being done, and <hi>Montroſe</hi> on his journey from
<hi>Oxford</hi> toward <hi>Scotland,</hi> thoſe that were the
<hi>Hamiltons</hi> creatures, and other falſe-hearted Courtiers began to

<hi>Montroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He being little troubled with the calumnies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy men, came forward to <hi>York,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Durham:</hi> where he ſees that the Kings Inſtructions be ſent to the Marqueſſe of
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the next day they met and conferred.
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> diſcours'd of nothing but the diſtreſſes and neceſſities of his Army; how the Rebell Scots breaking in in the midſt of Winter had ſpoiled his Recruits, and that now in farre greater numbers than he, they quartered within five miles of him; that he could not poſſibly ſpare any horſe without a manifeſt hazard to the whole Army.

               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> calling his friends to counſell, deſires them to deliver their opinions what they conceived was fitteſt to be done in this ſad face of things. Some adviſe him to repair to the King at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and certifie him that his Scotch Affairs were paſt recovery; that <hi>Antrim</hi> came not with his Iriſh Forces, nor was there any appearance of them; that little or no aſſiſtance had been obtained from the Engliſh; and as for Arms or aid from Forreign parts, he had not ſo much as heard a word of them; ſo that it was none of his fault that his ſervice had no better ſucceſſe. Others were of opinion that it was better for him to excuſe himſelf by Letters unto the King, and to ſend up his Commiſſion along with them, and that he himſelf ſhould ſtep a while aſide into ſome other Countrey, till ſuch time as it ſhould pleaſe God to ſend better opportunities. But all agreed in this, that nothing more was to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116000:18"/> or thought of in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But he himſelf only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained far other thoughts in his high and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirit: He conceived himſelf bound never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his deareſt Lord the King though in extremeſt hazards, and that it was an unworthineſſe to deſpair of ſo good a cauſe; and if he ſhould attempt ſome greater matter than came within the reach or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of common men, he conjectured it might prove much to his own Honour, and ſomething per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to the Kings good too. For as it was dubious whether it might pleaſe God in his mercy to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King with a more favourable eye, and to turn his adverſity into proſperity; ſo it was moſt certain, that if he ſhould not be able to goe thorough with it, but periſh in the enterpriſe, he ſhould die with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his fall ſhould be much lamented. So reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and commending himſelf and his ſucceſſe to the diſpoſall and protection of Almighty God, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſuch Adventures without men, without money, without arms, as were not only to the aſtoniſhment of us that were preſent, and were eye and ear witneſſes of them, but alſo the example and envy both of all great Commanders hereafter. What thoſe were we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> delivers thoſe few Gentlemen that had been conſtant unto him to the Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted unto the King, (for as he had communicated all his former deſigns unto him, ſo he did this alſo) and conjureth him withall to deal earneſtly with his Majeſty for haſtening of ſome aid, if not of Men, yet of Arms at leaſt, from beyond Seas. So he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them two dayes on their journey, and leaving with them his Horſes, his Servants, and his Carriages, conveyed himſelf privily away from them, and with what ſpeed he could, came back to
<hi>Carliſle.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſuſpecting nothing of his departure, becauſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116000:19"/> 
                  <hi>Ogleby</hi> and other his deareſt friends were ſtill with them, marched on ſtraight towards <hi>Oxford;</hi> but thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they never reached, for moſt of them (of whom were the Lord
<hi>Ogleby</hi> himſelf, Sir <hi>John Innes,</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Henry Graham</hi> his brother, a moſt hopefull young Gentleman, <hi>James, John,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Oglebyes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Melvin,</hi> and other gallant men, and highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Montroſe)</hi> fell into the enemies hands, and endured a long and naſty impriſonment, untill they were ſet at liberty by <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf the next year, after which they did him moſt faithfull ſervice. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Carliſle</hi> imparts his deſign to the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> leſt he ſhould have any occaſion to cavill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that a matter of that conſequence was done without his knowledge or advice, who might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved able to give a great ſtroke to the advancing of it. But when he found ſomething too much fickleneſſe in that young man, he was not over earneſt to Engage him to adventure with him in ſo perillous a journey; and therefore eaſily perſwaded him to reſide at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> till he heard further news out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which time it might be more ſeaſonable for him to return into his Country.</p>
               <p>And now being prepared for his journey, he ſelected only two men for his companions and guides; one was Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> a Gentleman of moſt known ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and an able man both of his head and hands. The other was one <hi>Sibbald,</hi> whom for the report of his valour and gallantry, <hi>Montroſe</hi> did equally love and honour: but the latter afterwards deſerted him in his greateſt need. <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſing as <hi>Sibbalds</hi> man, and being diſguiſed in the habit of a Groom, rode along upon a lean jade, and led another horſe in his hand. And ſo he came to the borders, where he found all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſafe paſſes guarded by the enemy. There was a chance happened which put them in a greater
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116000:19"/> fright than all that, and it was this; not farre from the borders they hit by chance upon a ſervant of Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Grahams,</hi> who taking them for Covenanters, and to be of <hi>Leſley</hi>'s Army who uſed to range about thoſe parts, told them freely and confidently that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had made his peace with the Covenanters, and had undertaken (as if he were their Centinell) to diſcover unto them all ſuch as came that way whom he ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to favour the King. An unworthy act it was of a ſhameleſs villain, of whom not only <hi>Montroſe</hi> had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high eſteem, but his Majeſty alſo, whoſe miſtaken bounty had raiſed him out of the dunghill (to ſay no worſe) unto the honour of Knighthood, and an eſtate even to the envy of his neighbours.</p>
               <p>Having not paſſed much further, they met a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a Scotchman, but one that had ſerved under the Marqueſſe of
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who taking no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the other two Gentlemen, came to <hi>Montroſe</hi> and ſaluted him by his name:
<hi>Montroſe</hi> giving no heed unto him, as if he were no ſuch man, the

                  </gap>oo officious ſouldier would not be ſo put off, but with a voyce and countenance full of humility and duty began to cry out, <hi>What? Doe not I know my Lord Marqueſſe of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe <hi>well enough? Goe your way, and God be with you whitherſoever you goe.</hi> When he ſaw it was in vain to conceal himſelf from the man, he gave him a few crowns and ſent him away, nor did he diſcover him afterwards. But <hi>Montroſe</hi> conceiving himſelf much concerned in theſe ſpeeches, thought it the beſt courſe to make all the haſte he could, and to run faſter than the news of him could flie: nor did he ſpare any horſe-fleſh, or ſcarce draw a bridle till after four dayes travell he came to the houſe of his coſen <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Graham</hi> of
<hi>Innisbrake,</hi> not far from the river of <hi>Tay</hi> on that ſide of the Sherifdome of <hi>Perth</hi> which is next the mountains, This
<hi>Patrick</hi> being deſcended of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116000:20"/> the noble family of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and not unworthy of ſo noble parentage, was deſervedly in very great eſteem with the Marqueſſe; who ſojourned beſides him for a little while in the day time in a mean cottage, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the nights alone in the neighbouring mountains. For he had ſent away his companions unto his friends, that they might inform themſelves exactly of the whole ſtate of the Kingdome, and bring him word in what condition they found it.</p>
               <p>After a few dayes, having examined the matter with all the induſtry they could uſe, they return with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſad and tragicall newes: <hi>That all the Subjects that were honeſt and loyall, lay under the tyranny of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells; and of ſuch as had been ſo hardy as to endeavour to recover their freedome with their ſwords, ſome were put to death, others fined, others being yet in priſon, daily expected the worſt their enemies could doe: That the Marqueſſe of</hi> Huntley <hi>had laid down the arms, which too unadviſedly he had taken up, at the firſt ſummons of the enemy; that indeed he had had no contemptible number of men, but the men wanted agood Commander; that his friends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants were expoſed to the implacable malice and revenge of their enemies, and that he himſelf had fled to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt corner of the Iland, and ſculked upon another mans land. Montroſe</hi> was very much troubled (as he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) at this news, eſpecially at <hi>Huntley</hi>'s errour and the ruine of the
<hi>Gordons,</hi> who were men of ſingular loyalty and valour, and expert ſouldiers, therefore much lamented by him, that for no fault of theirs, they ſhould come to ſo great misfortune. And now he began to caſt about how he might draw them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they might try again the fortune of War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Generall in the behalf of his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time there were ſome uncertain reports ſpread abroad among the Shepheards who kept their flocks in the mountains, of certain Iriſh who were landed in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ranged about the mountains. <hi>Montroſe</hi> conceived it not unlikely that theſe might be part of thoſe Auxiliaries which the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> had promiſed ſhould have been there four moneths before: but he had no certainly what they were, till at laſt ſome Letters came from ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friends of his, Highlanders, and from <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mac-donell,</hi> a Scotchman alſo, to whom <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>im</hi> had given the Command in chief of thoſe few Iriſh, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to
<hi>Montroſe.</hi> Theſe they had taken care to ſend to a certain friend of his, a ſure man, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them if it were poſſible to
<hi>Carliſle,</hi> where <hi>Montroſe</hi> was beleeved ſtill to remain. He, who never dreamed of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s return into <hi>Scotland,</hi> though he ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, by chance acquainted Maſter <hi>Patrick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with the buſineſſe, he promiſeth to take charge of them, and undertaketh to ſee them ſafely delivered to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> though he made a journey as far as <hi>Carliſle</hi> of purpoſe; and ſo by the good providence of God they came into his hands much ſooner than could be expected. And he writes back, as from <hi>Carliſle,</hi> that they ſhould be of good comfort, for they ſhould not ſtay long either for ſufficient aſſiſtance to joyn with them, or a Generall to command them; and withall requires them forthwith to come down into <hi>Athole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Athole</hi> were engaged unto
<hi>Montroſe</hi> by many obligations, men whom he valued moſt of all the Highlanders, both for their Loyalty, Piety, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and ſingular Valour: and truly they made good his opinion of them to the very end of the War. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116000:21"/> Iriſh, with a very few Highlanders who were almoſt all of <hi>Badenoth,</hi> receiving <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s commands, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſtraight into <hi>Athole.</hi> He, who was not above twenty miles from them, comes to them immediatly, and ere ever they looked for him, on foot, in the habit of a Mountainer, without any man along with him ſave the aboveſaid <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> his guide and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. And indeed the Iriſh would hardly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that that was
<hi>Montroſe;</hi> but when they ſaw him ſo ſaluted, and only not adored like ſome great Deity, by the men of <hi>Athole,</hi> and others that knew him well, they were overjoyed: for his comming to them was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good time, they being then in extreme danger to be cut off. For <hi>Argyle</hi> was in their rear with a ſtrong and well ordered Army, the champain countrey were ready in arms before them, expecting, if they ſhould make down into the Plain, to trample them to dirt with their horſes hoofes; the veſſels that brought them over were burnt by <hi>Argyle,</hi> that they might have no way to retreat; nor would the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, or any other that favoured the King venture any hazard with them, becauſe they were ſtrangers, and came not by the Kings open and known Authority; nor had they any Commander of antient Nobility, a thing by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers much ſet by, who would not fight under the command of <hi>Alexander Mac-donell,</hi> a man of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with them; laſtly their number was inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being not above eleven hundred, though ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand had been promiſed.</p>
               <p>The next day the <hi>Athole-</hi>men to the number of eight hundred put themſelves in arms, and offered their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice moſt chearfully to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> who having got this handfull of men, and earneſtly commending his moſt righteous Cauſe to the protection of Almighty God, now deſired nothing more than to be among the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the enemy. Impatient therefore of further delay,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116000:21"/> that very day he marches through the Plains of <hi>Athole,</hi> towards <hi>Ern,</hi> as well to make way for his friends and aſſiſtants eaſier acceſſe unto him (if any ſhould riſe upon the news) as that he might fall upon and amaze the Rebels, unlook'd for, before they ſhould be able to joyn together, who lay at diſtance. Therefore paſſing by <hi>Weme,</hi> a Caſtle of the <hi>Meniſes,</hi> ſeeing they handled a Trumpeter whom he ſent friendly unto them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, &amp; fell hotly upon the rear of his Army, he waſtes their fields; and cauſes all their houſes and corn to be fired; this was at the very firſt onſet of the War, to ſtrike terrour into the enemy. The ſame night he paſſed over <hi>Tay,</hi> the greateſt river in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with part of his Forces; the reſt follow him very early the next day, When they were ready to march on, he gave <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> (of whom I ſhall have often to ſpeak, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without honour) at their earneſt requeſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, and ſent him with the nimbleſt of them he could pick out amongſt them to ſcout be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He brings word he ſaw ſome Souldiers drawn up on the top of an hill at <hi>Buckinth:</hi> towards them
<hi>Montroſe</hi> makes ſtraight. Theſe proved to be commanded by the Lord <hi>Kilpont,</hi> ſon to the Earl of <hi>Taith,</hi> a man of ancient Nobility, and deſcended of the <hi>Grahams;</hi> and Sir <hi>John Drummond,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> a kinſman alſo of
<hi>Montroſe;</hi> who were both of them ſummoned by the Covenanters to joyn againſt the Iriſh as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, and had with them five hundred Foot and no more; nor had they heard any certainty at all of
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s being in thoſe parts. He reſolveth with all ſpeed to ſurpriſe them, and either to win them to his ſide, or to cruſh them to pieces. But they, as ſoon as they heard that <hi>Montroſe</hi> was generall of thoſe Forces, ſend unto him ſome of their chiefeſt friends to underſtand from him what he intended to doe. He tells them he had the Kings authority for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116000:22"/> what he did, and was reſolved to aſſert that Authority to the utmoſt of his power againſt a moſt horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, conjuring them by all the obligations that were between them, that they would not think much to do their beſt endeavours for the beſt of Kings. Which as it was much becomming their high birth, and would be very acceptable ſervice to the King, ſo it would be beneficiall to them for the preſent, and much to their honour with poſterity and ſtrangers, if they of all others ſhould be the firſt that put to their helping hands to hold up a tottering Crown. They moſt readily without any delay came in unto him, for both of them though underhand favoured the King exceedingly.</p>
               <p>From them <hi>Montroſe</hi> underſtood that the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were thick in arms at a Rendezvouz at <hi>Perth</hi> (the ſecond City to
<hi>Edinburgh)</hi> and there waited for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies falling down from
<hi>Athole.</hi> He knowing alſo that <hi>Argyle</hi> with his Army was upon his back, leſt he ſhould be hem'd in on both ſides, determines to goe forward to <hi>Perth,</hi> that there he might either force the enemy to fight, or reduce the Town to the Kings obedience. Marching therefore three miles from
<hi>Buckinth,</hi> and allowing the Souldiers but a ſhort time of refreſhment, at the break of day he draws out his men. Nor was he above three miles more from the City, when the enemy was in view in a large and open Plain (called <hi>Tippermore)</hi> providing to fight. They were commanded by the Lord <hi>Elchoe,</hi> one that was taken for no great Souldier: there were with him the Earl of <hi>Tullibar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Drummond,</hi> but this latter (as was conceived) againſt his will, for he and his fathers whole family favoured the King in their hearts: Knights he had with him good ſtore, among whom Sir <hi>James Scot</hi> (who heretofore had done good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice under the State of <hi>Venice)</hi> was the moſt noted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116000:22"/> ſouldier. They had ſix thouſand Foot, and ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and in confidence of their numbers, they had even devoured their enemies before they ſaw them. It was on Sunday the firſt of
<hi>September,</hi> and it was given in charge to their Miniſters, that in ſet Speeches they ſhould encourage the people to fight; not forgetting to mind them of their moſt holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant forſooth. And to give them their due they plyed their lungs ſtoutly in the performance of that work; they moſt freely promiſed them in the name of Almighty God an eaſie and unbloudy victory; nay, there was one <hi>Frederick Charmichael,</hi> one very much cryed up for learning and holineſſe by the ſilly people, who was not afraid to deliver this paſſage in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>If ever God ſpake word of truth out of my mouth, I promiſe you in his name aſſured victory this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods ſervice being thus finely performed as they thought, they put their men in <hi>Battalia. Elchoe</hi> himſelf commanded the right flank, Sir <hi>James Scot</hi> the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

To the right and left flanks were added wings of Horſe, with which they made no doubt on ſo fair a Plain to hemme in the enemy. <hi>Montroſe</hi> perceiving the great body of the enemy, and eſpecially their ſtrength in Horſe, (for he had not ſo much as one Horſe-man, nor more than three lean Horſes) and being carefull (as it concerned him) leſt being incompaſſed with ſo great a number, they ſhould fall upon him in the Fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Kilpont,</hi> and the main Battell to <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with his Iriſh: which was very providently ordered, leſt the Iriſh who were neither uſed to fight with long Pikes, nor were furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſwords, if they had been placed on either flank ſhould have been expoſed to the fury of the Scotch Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſent unto the Commanders of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Drummond</hi> Son and Heir to the Lord <hi>Maderty,</hi> a noble Gentleman, and accompliſhed with all kind of vertues, who declared in his name, <hi>That</hi> Montroſe, <hi>as well as the Kings Majeſty from whom he had received his Commiſſion, was moſt tender of ſhedding his Countreys blood, and had nothing more in his devotions, than that his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might be written without a red Letter. And ſuch a victory they might obtain as well as he, if they ſhould pleaſe but to have the honour to conquer themſelves, and before a ſtroke were ſtruck to return unto their Allegiance. That for his part hee was covetous of no mans wealth, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of no mans honour, envious at no mans preferment, thirſty after no mans bloud; all that he deſired was, that in the name of God they would at length give eare to ſound counſell, and ſubmit themſelves, and what belonged unto them, unto the grace and protection of ſo good a King; who as he had hitherto condeſcended unto all things (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for matter of Religion or any thing elſe) which they thought good to ask, though to the exceeding great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his Prerogatives; ſo ſtill they might find him like an indulgant Father, ready to embrace his penitent children
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116000:23"/> in his arms, although he had been provoked with unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injuries. But if they ſhould continue ſtill obſtinate in their Rebellion, hee called God to witneſſe, that it was their own ſtubbornneſſe that forced him to the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</hi> The commanders of the enemies anſwered nothing at all to all this, but againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent the Meſſenger (who out of meer love to his Countrey had undertaken the employment) priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with a company of rude Souldiers unto <hi>Perth,</hi> vowing aſſoon as they had got the victory to cut off his head. But God was more mercifull to him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided otherwiſe than they intended, for the ſafety of that gallant man.</p>
               <p>They were come within Musket ſhot when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under the Command of the Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> ſent out a forlorn hope to provoke
<hi>Montroſe</hi> to a light skirmiſh: he ſends a few to meet them, who at the firſt on ſet diſorder and rout them, ſending them back to their main body in no ſmall fright. <hi>Montroſe</hi> thought now was his opportunity, and that nothing could conduce more either to the encouragement of his own ſouldiers, or the terrour of the enemy, than immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall upon them as they were diſordered and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with that freſh blow, nor would he give them time to rally or recover courage: therefore ſetting up a great ſhout, he lets looſe his whole Army upon them. The enemy firſt at diſtance diſcharge their Ordnance, which made more noiſe than they did harm, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards marching forward, their Horſe labour to break in upon

There was ſomething more to doe a little while longer in the right Flank. Sir <hi>James Scot</hi> diſputed ſometime for the higher ground, but <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men being ſtronger bodied, and eſpecially ſwifter foot men obtained the Hill; from thence the
<hi>Athole-</hi>men ruſhed down with their drawn ſwords upon the enemy, and making little account of the Muſquetiers, who ſent their bullets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them as thick as hail, cloſing with them (as they lik'd beſt to fight) they ſlaſh'd and beat them down. At laſt the enemy not able to abide their ſury, fairly ran away. Moſt of the Horſe made ſo good ſpeed as to ſave themſelves; but there was a great ſlaughter of the Foot, whom they purſued for ſix or ſeven miles. There were conceived to be two thouſand of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters ſlain, and more were taken priſoners: of whom ſome taking a Military Oath, took up arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the Conquerour; but perfidiouſly, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all forſook him afterwards. The reſt taking a Solemn Proteſtation that they would never after bear arms againſt the King, he ſet at liberty.

               <p>HE ſtaid three dayes at <hi>Perth,</hi> for there he expected many in thoſe parts to come in with their friends
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116000:24"/> and clients armed, who upon the noiſe of the late vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory profeſſed themſelves moſt faithfull to the King; but none came but the Earl of <hi>Kinoule</hi> with a few gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of
<hi>Gawry,</hi> nor did they continue very conſtant unto him neither. And by this time <hi>Argyle</hi> was at hand with a great Army of Foot of his own, and ſupplies of Horſe were joyned with him out of the South parts; therefore
<hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſing over the <hi>Tay,</hi> took up his Quarters in the field (for other quarters he ſeldome had) neer <hi>Couper</hi> a little village in <hi>Angus,</hi> where a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Monaſtery once ſtood, but now lies on the ground. Here a brave young gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Ogleby,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Arley,</hi> with others of the Gentry of <hi>Angus,</hi> met him, and readily offered him their ſervice; whom he courteouſly entertained, and ſent them away with thanks, they pretending they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to fit themſelves for a march, nevertheleſſe few of them returned beſides the <hi>Oglebies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next morning by break of day before the <hi>Revellier</hi> was beat, there was a great tumult in the Camp, the Souldiers ran to their arms, and fell to be wild and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; <hi>Montroſe</hi> gheſſing that it was ſome falling out between the Highlanders and the Iriſh, thruſt himſelf in amongſt the thickeſt of them: there he finds a moſt horrible murther newly committed, for the noble Lord <hi>Kilpontin</hi> lay there baſely ſlain. The murtherer was a retainer of his own, one <hi>Stuart,</hi> whom he had treated with much friendſhip and familiarity, in ſo much that that ſame night they lay both in a bed. It is reported that the baſe ſlave had a plot to diſpatch <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and in regard of the great power he had with <hi>Kilpontin,</hi> he conceived he might draw him in to be acceſſary to the villany, therefore taking him aſide into a private place, he had diſcovered unto him his intentions; which the Nobleman highly deteſted, as was meet; whereupon the murtherer fearing he would diſcover
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116000:25"/> him, aſſaulted him unawares, and ſtabbed him with many wounds, who little ſuſpected any harm from his friend and creature. The treacherous Aſſaſine by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Centinoll eſcaped, none being able to purſue him, it being ſo dark, that they could ſcarce ſee the ends of their Pikes. Some ſay the traitour was hired by the Covenanters to doe this, others only that he was promiſed a reward if he did it. Howſoever it was, this is moſt certain that he is very high in their favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this very day, and that <hi>Argyle</hi> immediatly advanced him (though he was no ſouldier) to great commands in his Army.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> was very much troubled with the loſſe of this Nobleman, his dear friend, and one that had deſerved very well both from the King and himſelf, a man famous for arts and arms, and honeſty; being a good Philoſopher, a good Divine, a good Lawyer, a good Souldier, a good Subject, and a good man: And embracing the breathleſſe body again and again with ſighes and tears, he delivers it to his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull friends and ſervants to be carried to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to receive its funerall Obſequies, as became the ſplendor of that honourable Family.</p>
               <p>With the reſt of his Forces <hi>Montroſe</hi> marcheth to
<hi>Dundee:</hi> the Town being proud of the number of its Inhabitants, and having a Garriſon out of <hi>Fife</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, refuſed to ſubmit. And he, thinking it no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to hazard the honour he had gotten by his late victory upon the doubtfull ſucceſſe of a ſiege, turns away towards
<hi>Eske;</hi> for he hoped that many of his friends and kindred, being men of greateſt note in thoſe parts, and who uſed to talk as highly what they would doe for the King as any others, would be ready to joyn with him. But they having news of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach withdrew themſelves: only the Lord
<hi>Ogleby</hi> Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> a man of threeſcore years old, (with his two Sons, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Sir <hi>David,</hi> and ſome of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116000:25"/> his friends, and clients, men of experienced reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) joyned himſelf unto him: and with admirable conſtancy he went along with him through all fortunes unto the very end of the War; being in that almoſt univerſall defection, the other honour and ornament of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> beſides <hi>Montroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While <hi>Montroſe</hi> was hereabouts, he receives intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that ſome Commiſſioners from the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (of whom the Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> was the principall) lay at <hi>Aberdene</hi> with an Army, and laboured to aſſure unto themſelves the Northern parts, upon which <hi>Montroſe</hi> eſpecially relyed, either by fair means or foul. Hee determines to fight theſe immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Argyle</hi> could come up to them, therefore with long marches hee hies thither, and poſſeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelt of the bridge upon the river of <hi>Dee,</hi> and drawing neer the Citie, he found the enemy drawn up cloſe beſide it.
<hi>Burghley</hi> commanded two thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe whom he placed in wings; and having thoſen his ground, and planted his great Guns before his men, hee expected battell. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> had fifteen hundred Foot (for the Lord <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontins</hi> Souldiers were gone to convey their Lords dead body to his Parents, and moſt of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men after the victory of <hi>Perth</hi> were gone home, from whence they were not farre, laden with ſpoil) and juſt four and forty Horſe, of whom he made two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and mixing amongſt them the beſt fire-men and Archers that he had (who in nimbleneſſe and ſwiftneſſe of body were almoſt as good as horſemen) placed them on either wing, to prevent the falling of the enemies Horſe upon his rear; which they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt gallantly beyond the opinion, or perhaps the belief of many. He gave the command of the right flank to <hi>James Hay</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> and of the left to Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> all valiant men.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116000:26"/> The left wing of the enemy was commanded by
<hi>Lewis Gordon,</hi> Son to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley,</hi> a bold young man and hot ſpirited, but hair-brain'd, and one that had forced out his fathers friends and clients to fight with <hi>Montroſe</hi> againſt their wills. He having gotten the plain and moſt commodious ground for fighting on horſe-back, charged <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s right flank: which when he perceived, he commanded <hi>Rollock</hi> with his twenty Horſe to their aid, and they being backed with the gallantry of their Commanders, and the activity and ſtoutneſſe of the Foot amongſt them, received the charge with ſo much hardineſſe, that they four and forty, beat back full three hundred of the enemy, rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, and killing very many. But becauſe they were ſo few, they durſt not follow the chaſe: which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by the great prudence of the Commandets, and proved to be of great conſequence towards the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the victory: for the enemy charged <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s left Flank (which had no Horſe) with their right Wing of Horſe.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore in a trice (now that <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> and his men were fled) conveighs the ſame Horſe to the left Flank; who ſeeing they were not able to draw themſelves into a Body like the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, fetch'd a compaſſe about, and ſo eſcaped their firſt charge; then neatly wheeling about, they fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Flank of the enemy, and with their naked ſwords, beat, and cut, and vanquiſh, and put them to flight. They took priſoners one <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Kragevar</hi> a Knight of great eſteem with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Boindle.</hi> Thoſe that retreated got ſafe away, becauſe that ſo few could not ſafely purſue them. They that commanded the enemies Horſe were not ſo much frighted with their loſſe, as vexed with the diſgrace of a double repulſe, therefore imputing their defeat to thoſe light fire-locks that were mixed with <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Horſe, they themſelves call for Foot-men out of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116000:26"/> main Body, intending to return with greater courage. <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſuſpected that, and was loath to engage thoſe few gallant men again, (whoſe Horſes were ſpent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

Therefore obſerving the enemies Horſe not yet rallied ſince their new rout, and ſtanding at a ſufficient diſtance from their Foot; he rode about among his own Foot (who had been ſore galled already with the enemies Ordinance) and beſpeaks them to this effect: <hi>We doe no good (my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſouldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Goe to therefore, fall about them with your ſwords and butt-end of your Muskets, beat them down, drive them back, and make them pay what is juſtly due for their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and rebellion.</hi> It was no ſooner ſaid, than they fall to work, break in upon the enemy, defeat them, rout them. Their Horſe who expected Foot to come and line them, ſeeing them all run away, ran faſter than they: whom the Conquerours were not able to follow, much leſſe to overtake, ſo they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For having no other place to fly unto, but into the City, <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men came in thronging amonſt them through the gates and poſterns, and laid them on heaps all over the ſtreets. They fought four hours upon ſuch equall tetmes, that it was an even lay whether had the odds. At this Battell
<hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſome great Guns, but they were unſerviceable, becauſe all advantages of ground were poſſeſſed by the enemy; but the enemies Guns made no ſmall havock of his men. Among others, there was an Iriſhman that had his legge ſhot off with a Cannon bullet, only it hung
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116000:27"/> by a little skin; he ſeeing his fellow-ſouldiers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſad at his miſchance, with a loud and cheerfull voyce cryes out, <hi>Come on, my Comerades, this is but the fortune of Warre, and neither you nor I have reaſon to be ſorry for it. Doe you ſtand to it as becomes you, and as for me, I am ſure my Lord marqueſſe, ſeeing I can no longer ſerve on foot, will mount me on horſe-back:</hi> So drawing out his knife, being nothing altered nor troubled, he cut aſunder the skin with his own hand, and gave his legge to one of his fellow-ſouldiers to bury. And truly when he was well again, and made a Trooper, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did very faithfull and gallant ſervice. This battell was fought at
<hi>Aberdene</hi> on the twelfth day of <hi>September,</hi> 1644. Then
<hi>Montroſe</hi> calling his ſouldiers back to their Colours entered the City, and allowed them two dayes reſt.</p>

And there wanted not ſome of them, who teſtified their great affection to the ſervice, but that <hi>Huntley</hi> the chief of the Family, being a back-friend to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> had with-held them all, either by his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or private directions; and that himſelf being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſculk in the utmoſt border of the Kingdome, envied that honour to another of which he had miſſed himſelf, and had forbidden, even with threats, all thoſe with whom he had any power to have any thing to doe with <hi>Mentroſe,</hi> or to aſſiſt him either with their power or counſell. Which when he underſtood, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to withdraw his Forces into the Mountains and Faſtneſſeſſes, where he knew the enemies Horſe (wherein their great ſtrength conſiſted) could do them little ſervice; and of their Foot (if they were never ſo many) relying upon the juſtice of his cauſe, and the valour of his ſouldiers, be made but little reckoning. Therefore he hid his Ordnance in a bogge, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his troubleſome and heavy carriages.

                  </gap>ce paſſable for Horſe. There for certain dayes he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116000:28"/> was very ſick, which occaſioned ſo immoderate joy to the Covenanters, that they doubted not to give out he was quite dead, and to ordain a day of publike Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to Almighty God for that great deliverance. Nor were their Levites you may be ſure backward in that employment in their Pulpits; for as if they had been of counſell at the Decree, and ſtood by at the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they aſſured the people that it was as true as Goſpell, that the Lord of Hoſtes had ſlain
<hi>Montroſe</hi> with his own hands. But this joy did not laſt them long, for he recovered in a ſhort ſpace; and as if he had been riſen from the dead, he frighted his enemies much more than he had done before. For aſſoon as his diſeaſe would give him leave, he returned into <hi>Athole,</hi> and ſent away <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with a party unto the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, to invite them to take up arms with him; and if they would not be invited, to force them. He himſelf goes into <hi>Angus,</hi> hoping it might happen that he ſhould either force <hi>Argyle</hi> with his tyred Horſe unto his Winter quarters, or at leaſt leave him far enough behind him. For <hi>Argyle</hi> had purſued him ſo ſlowly, and at ſuch diſtance, that it was apparent he thought of nothing leſſe than of giving him battell. Therefore going through <hi>Angus,</hi> and getting over the <hi>Grainsbaine</hi> (which going along with a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ridge from Eaſt to Weſt, divideth
<hi>Scotland</hi> into two equall parts) he returned into the North of the Kingdome. And now that he had left <hi>Argyle</hi> ſo farre hehind him, that he might ſafely take ſome time to recruit, he went to <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> that he might meet with the <hi>Gordons,</hi> and perſwade them to engage with him. But he loſt his labour, for they were foreſtalled by
<hi>Huntley,</hi> and after his example plaid leaſt in ſight. For ſuch as were generous and daring ſpirits, though they were loath to provoke the indignation of their Chief, yet they could not but be aſhamed, that at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116000:28"/> a time when there might be ſo much uſe of them they did nothing. Beſides, the Lord <hi>Gordon, Huntley</hi>'s el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son (a man of ſingular worth and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was detained by
<hi>Argyle</hi> his Uncle by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide: the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> the ſecond Son was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within the ſiege of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> and
<hi>Lewis</hi> anot her Son was of the enemies ſide; ſo that there was no one of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s family under whoſe authority they ſhould take up Arms.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Montroſe</hi> quartered there a great while; in which time almoſt every other night march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeven, or eight, or ten miles with a party of light Foot (for Horſe he had few or none) he uſed to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms to the enemy, beat up their quarters, put them to flight, and frequently to bring home horſe and men, priſoners. And becauſe he alwaies brought his men ſafe off, it was ſtrange to ſee how cheerfull and daring his ſouldiers were; ſo that though their number was not great, there was nothing that he would lead them on unto, that ſeemed great to them. At laſt when he deſpaired of any good to be done with the
<hi>Gordons,</hi> at the end of <hi>October</hi> he removed from
<hi>Strathbogy,</hi> and came to <hi>Faivy</hi> Caſtle and poſſeſt it. There he was like to have been utterly undone by the bad and falſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence his ſcouts in whom he put great confidence brought unto him concerning the enemy: for thoſe whom they perſwaded him were ſcarce got over <hi>Grainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baine</hi> were on a ſudden encamped within two miles of him, <hi>Argyle</hi> &amp; <hi>Lothian</hi> had there t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If he ſhould have deſcended into the Plain with ſo ſmall ſtrength it had been madneſſe; and to keep a Caſtle (and no ſtrong one neither) he thought diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and derogatory to the credit of his late victories.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116000:29"/> Therefore he bethought himſelf of another courſe, he draws his men up unto a higher hill which over-look'd the Caſtle. The ſoil of the hill was rough, and there were hedges alſo and ditches caſt up there by Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen for the fences of their fields, which were almoſt as uſefull as Breaſt-works. But before he had appointed every one his ground to draw up in, thoſe few of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s dependants which accompanied <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> from <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> in the ſight of all people fairly betook them to their heels. And on the other ſide, the enemy driving fiercely up the hill, made themſelves maſters of no ſmall part of it; which if they had been able to maintain with the ſame vigour that they had obtained it, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had been a loſt man: whoſe Souldiers, diſcouraged both by the timorous flight of ſome of their own, and the multitude of their enemies forces, were well-neer ready to turn their backs; them <hi>Montroſe</hi> preſently put life and courage into by his own example and preſence, by putting them in mind of their former atchievements, and their own ſence of their wonted proweſſe. Moreover he thus beſpake a young Iriſh Gentleman, one Collonell <hi>O Kyan, Goe thy way,</hi> O Kyan, <hi>with ſuch men as thou haſt at hand, and drive me thoſe fellows out of yonder ditches, that we may be no more troubled with them.</hi> The gallantry of <hi>O Kyan Montroſe</hi> had often ſeen and commended, nor did that truly valiant man deceive the Generalls opinion of him, for he quickly firretted the enemy out of the ditches, though they much out-numbred his men, and were ſeconded with a party of Horſe. And not only ſo, but gained ſome baggs of powder which the enemy had left behind them for haſte, a very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prey, of which they had great need. Nor doth a notable example of the forwardneſſe of the Souldiers ſeem to me unworthy in this place to be remembred; for one of them looking upon the baggs of powder,

               <p>In the mean time his Horſe (which were but fifty) being diſpoſed in a place of danger, he timely ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them by lining them with Musquettiers. For <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thain</hi> charged them with five whole Troops, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had croſſed over half a field that lay between them, being ſcared with our ſhot, wheel'd about, and returned to the place from whence they came. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s men being encouraged with theſe two ſucceſſes could ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Towards night, <hi>Argyle</hi> having done nothing to any purpoſe, retreats two miles off, and ſlept not that night. But the next day, when he was told that <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſouldiers had great ſcarcity of powder and bullet, drawing his men into the ſame ground again, he made as though hee would have charged up the Hill, and beaten <hi>Montroſe</hi> out of his hold. But when his heart failed him in that enterpriſe, beſides ſome skirmiſhes between ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, while the main bodies kept their ground, there was nothing done that day neither. All this while <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> ſends for all diſhes and flaggons, and chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, and what other pewter veſſels could be had, and cauſed them to be melted into bullet; yet when that was done, the ſouldiers had not enough. With which great inconvenience the ſouldiers were ſo little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that one as often as he made a ſhot (which he preſumed never miſſed) he would ſay merrily to his Comerades, <hi>As ſure as can be I have broken one Traytors face with a chamber-pot.</hi> Nor will any one wonder if

                  <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men were oft in want of powder, and other neceſſaries for War, when he conſiders they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to ſupply themſelves with them but out of their enemies ſtock.

<hi>Montroſe</hi> by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them indemnity and rewards to boot; but (which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116000:30"/> is a ſhame to ſay even of an enemy) ſet a great price upon <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s head, to be paid unto any aſſaſſine or murtherer that ſhould bring it in. Of which, when
<hi>Montroſe</hi> was well aſſured, (who well knew the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the man to be more bent to overreach and betray, than to fight with his enemy) he thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerned him more, than with all ſpeed to bring off thoſe ſmall Forces he had as far as he could, both from
<hi>Argyle</hi>'s Horſe and knavery.</p>
               <p>Therefore calling a counſell of War, he declares his opinion, they all approve his wiſdome, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to continue their fidelity, and their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſerve him. Therefore he reſolveth upon a long march the next night, as far as <hi>Badenoth;</hi> and that the Souldiers might be lighter for ſo great a journey, he ſent the Carriages before with a guard, and bid the ſouldiers make themſelves ready againſt the next day, as if they were to fight. And now the Carriages were on the way, when on a ſudden news came that <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Cregaver,</hi> a priſoner, (to whom upon the engagement of his Honour for his true impriſonment
<hi>Montroſe</hi> had given the liberty of the Camp) and that

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtraight called back the Convoy with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and ſeemed as if he had wholly altered his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. But indeed he altered them not, but thought it fit to delay them for a time, that the intelligence which the enemy received from his fugitives might appear unto them idle and uncertain.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, thoſe Highlanders who did not only favour the Kings cauſe, but hated</hi> Argyle
<hi>heartily, as having had a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent experience of his Tyranny, durſt not appear as they would till he was firſt ſubdued. And laſtly the Low-lands of the Kingdome were maintained by the Covenanters with ſtrong Garriſons, and great bodyes of Horſe: ſo that except hee had a mind utterly to undoe his friends, he had no other place to Winter his Souldiers in but that.</hi> And <hi>being preſſed with theſe reaſons, with long and ſoul journeys, and incredible ſpeed he commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Argylc.</p>
               <p>The Earl at that time was liſting Souldiers in his Country, and had appointed the day and place for a Rendezvouz. He lived ſecurely in the Caſtle of <hi>Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare,</hi> ſuppoſing no enemy to be within a hundred miles of him. For he could never before be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that an Army could get into <hi>Argyle</hi> on foot in the midſt of Summer, and many times heretofore he has been heard to bragge, that he had rather loſe a hundred thouſand Crowns, than any mortall man ſhould know the way by which an Army could enter into his Country. When he therefore ſuſpected nothing leſſe, the trembling Cow-herds came down from the hills, and told him the enemy was within two miles. He not knowing what to do, and almoſt beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for fear, at laſt commits himſelf to a fiſher-boat, and flies away; leaving his friends and ſervants, and the whole Country to their fortunes, and the mercy of an enemy. It is a rough and mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, barren of corn, for little or none is ſown there, but very commodious for paſture, the chief riches of the Inhabitants conſiſting in cattell.
<hi>Mantroſe</hi> divides his Army into three Brigades, and ſends them about
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116000:31"/> the Country; one Brigade was commanded by the chief of the <hi>Mac-renalds,</hi> another by <hi>Mac-donel,</hi> and the third by himſelf. They range about all the Country, and lay it waſte; as many as they find in arms going to the Rendezvouz appointed by their Lord, they ſlay, and ſpare no man that was fit for War: nor do they give over till they had driven all ſerviceable men out of that Territory, or at leaſt into holes known to none but themſelves. Then they fire the Villages and Cotts, and lay them levell with the ground: in that retaliating <hi>Argyle</hi> with the ſame meaſure he had meeted unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who was the firſt in all the Kingdome that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted his Country-men with fire and ſword. Laſtly, they drive their cattell. Nor did they deal more gently with others, who lived in <hi>Lorn,</hi> and the neighbour parts, that acknowledged <hi>Argyle</hi>'s power. Theſe things laſted from the 13. of <hi>December</hi> 1644. to the
28. or 29. of <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
               <p>And indeed, he uſed never more to acknowledge the ſingular providence and fatherly mercy of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, than in bringing him and his men ſafe out of thoſe places; for if but two hundred Souldiers had handſomly kept thoſe Paſſes, they might caſily ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have cut off, or at leaſt driven back all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Beſides, if the Cow-herds had but driven away their cattell (which they might eaſily have done) in thoſe barren places he muſt have ſtarved for hunger. Or thirdly, if it had been a ſharp and ſtormy Winter, (and it ſeldome chances to be otherwiſe there) they had either been drowned in ſnow-drifts, or ſtarv'd and benummed with cold. But mercifull God took away both courage from the enemie, and its ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temper from the ayr; and ſupplyed their want of bread with great abundance of fleſh. At length departing out of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Lorn, Glencow,</hi> and <hi>Aber,</hi> hee came to
<hi>Logh-Neſſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:116000:32"/> And now he expected that all the Highlanders being either frighted with the example of <hi>Argyle,</hi> or freed from the fear of him, ſhould be ready to aſſiſt the Kings moſt righteous cauſe, and vindicate it with their arms againſt the Rebells.</p>
               <p>But now leſt <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s heroicall ſpirit ſhould ever want matter to work upon, he is advertiſed that the Earl of
<hi>Seafort,</hi> a very powerfull man in thoſe parts (and one of whom he had entertained a better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) with the Garriſon of <hi>Innerneſſe,</hi> which were old ſouldiers, and the whole ſtrength of <hi>Murray, Roſſe, Sutherland, Cathnes,</hi> and the ſept of the <hi>Fraſers,</hi> were ready to meet him with a deſperate army of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe and Foot.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> had only fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, for thoſe of
<hi>Clanrenald,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men ſuſpecting no ſuch need of them, and being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the ſpoyles of <hi>Argyle,</hi> had got leave to goe home, on condition they ſhould return when they were ſent for. But for all that, <hi>Montroſe</hi> was not afraid to give battell to that diſorderly Army: for although he knew thoſe of the Garriſon to be old ſouldiers, yet he accounted of the reſt of the multitude (which were newly raiſed out of Husbandmen, Cow-Herds, Pedees, Tavern-boyes, and Kitchin-boyes) to be altogether raw and unſerviceable.</p>
               <p>And now while he thought of nothing but fighting theſe, a truſty Meſſenger overtakes him, and informs him, that <hi>Argyle</hi> having gathered forces out of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the Kingdom, and joyned unto them ſuch Highlanders as yet adhered unto him, had come down into
<hi>Aber</hi> with three thouſand Foot, and ſtaid at an old Caſtle called
<hi>Innerlogh</hi> upon the bank of <hi>Logh-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Montroſe</hi> who well underſtood the crafty and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly diſpoſition of <hi>Argyle,</hi> by that had a good gheſſe at his deſign; which was to follow after him at a good diſtance, that he might be firſt engaged with thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116000:32"/> Northern men, and then to make his own advantage of the event of that battell; but by no means to fight himſelf if he could help it. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that it would be a matter of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of leſſe danger, to let men ſee that
<hi>Argyle</hi> was not invincible even in the Highlands, where he was adored by the ſimple people like ſome great-little god: and as for the Northern Army, he conceived that upon the report of a victory obtained againſt
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> it would moulder away, and eaſily be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> was thirty miles abſent from <hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh,</hi> neither would he goe the high-way thither (though he placed guards in it leſt the enemy ſhould have any intelligence of his moving) but ſtreighr over
<hi>Logh-Aber</hi> hills, in untroden paths, and only known to Cowherds and Huntſ-men, (for in thoſe mountains there are great herds of Deer) by a way that never man led an Army before; and killing their Scouts, was upon the back of the enemy ere he was aware.

When <hi>Montroſe</hi> perceived them to be in a poſture ſo quickly, he ſtood ſtill a little while till his Rear being tired with ſo hard a march could come up unto his Front. It was night, but the Moon-ſhone ſo clearly, that it was almoſt as light as day; all night they ſtood to their arms, and making frequent fallies and skirmiſhes one with another, neither gave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave to reſt or retreat. All others earneſtly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted day, only <hi>Argyle</hi> being more adviſed than the reſt conveyed himſelf away at dead of the night; and this ſecond time taking boat, ſaved himſelf from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of battell, as if he intended to be Umpire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Armies, and being himſelf out of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot ſtand ſpectatour of other mens valour, and well too. At the break of day,
<hi>Montroſe</hi> ordered his men as

But their ſouldiers that were in the Front having only once diſcharged their Muskets, and
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men preſſing on fiercely to come to the dint of ſword, began to run. Whom they, raiſing a great ſhout, ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſued, that as it were at one aſſault they routed them all; and had the killing of them with a moſt horrible ſlaughter for nine miles together.

Montroſe</hi> hies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe, either to draw them to his ſide, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them: but the very report of his advancing blew away that cloud, for they in great amazement ſhifted for themſelves every one whither he could.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> nevertheleſs goes on his march, and takes in
<hi>Elgin</hi> by ſurrender on the fourteenth day of <hi>February.</hi> At which time the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Marqueſſe of
<hi>Huntley,</hi> (a man who can never be ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his excellent endowments) came off openly to the Kings ſide (from his Uncle by whom he had been detained againſt his will) and, with not many but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry choiſe friends and clients, voluntarily did his duty, and offered his ſervice to <hi>Montroſe</hi> as the Kings Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vicegerent.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> firſt welcomed him with all civility, and gave him many thanks; afterwards when he came to underſtand him more inwardly, joyned him unto himſelf in the entireſt bonds of friendſhip and affection.

               <p>At <hi>Brechin</hi> ſome ſeven miles from thence, Sir

                  </gap>w up his men and charged. But when he perceived (too late) the Foot that ran cloſe after
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Horſe, he ſounded a retreat, and <hi>Hurrey</hi> himſelf turning his men before him, behaved himſelf ſtoutly in the rear. When they turned their backs, <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſouldiers drive on, let fly, and lay about them, untill being got over the river of <hi>Eske,</hi> the enemy ſcarce ſafe under the protection of Night, betook themſelves to ſhelter: nor did they think themſelves ſecure till after a race of four and twenty miles long they came to <hi>Dundee.</hi> Then they that had purſued them ſo far, returned to <hi>Fethercarne,</hi> and thence the next day to <hi>Brechin.</hi> Here <hi>Montroſe</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that
<hi>Baily</hi> a Commander of great account had been fetched out of
<hi>England,</hi> to be Generall of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Forces; that <hi>Hurrey</hi> with his Horſe was joyned unto him, and that they had in their Army many old ſouldiers brought back out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo that now the Covenanters going about their buſineſſe in ſo great ſadneſſe, <hi>Montroſe</hi> muſt expect not only other kind of ſouldiers, but alſo moſt expert Commanders to deal with.</p>
               <p>Therefore, leſt he ſhould chance to be hem'd in with their Horſe (in which their chief ſtrength lay) he chooſeth his moſt convenient way by the foot of <hi>Grainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baine</hi> towards the river of

So he went to the Caſtle of <hi>Innercarity,</hi> and the next day to a Village called <hi>Eliot.</hi> And here again leaving the mountains behind him he deſcends into the plain, and by a Trumpet ſends a challenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Baily</hi> to ſight. Between their two Armies ran the river <hi>Ile,</hi> which neither could ſafely paſſe over without the others conſent. <hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore deſires <hi>Baily</hi> to give him leave ſafely to come over to that ſide, which motion if
<hi>Baily</hi> ſhould not like of, he offered him a ſafe and free paſſage, on condition, that he would engage his honour to fight without further delay. <hi>Baily</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he would look to his own buſineſſe himſelf, and would not have other men teach him when to fight. Thus the two armies fac'd one another many dayes, neither the enemy endevouring to paſſe their Forces over the river againſt
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> nor he hoping to make good his paſſe unto them by reaſon of his ſcarcity of Horſe. Marching therefore to

               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> being fore afflicted with this unexpected revolt, although he was of neceſſity to return into the North to gather new Forces, yet made as if neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he went ſtraight towards the

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116000:36"/> open the gates, and poſſeſſe themſelves of the Church and Market-place, and others ſet the Town on ſire in ſeverall places. And indeed had not the common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by an unſeaſonable avarice and intemperance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themſelves to pillage, that rich Town had been immediately all one fire. But as it happened it was better both for the conquerours and conquered that it was not, for all the intelligence that the Scouts had brought in concerning the enemies comming over the <hi>Tay</hi> was abſolutely falſe: it may be they ſaw a few Troops (and many they did not ſee) paſſe over it, which they beleeved to have been the whole body of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and by that means were like to have undone both themſelves and the whole party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſtood upon the top of a hill cloſe unto
<hi>Dundee</hi> looking upon this onſlaught, when his almoſt breathleſſe Scouts brought him news that <hi>Baily</hi> and <hi>Hurrey</hi> with three thouſand Foot, and eight hundred Horſe were ſcarce a mile off. He immediatly calls his men out of the Town, which he had much to doe to perſwade them; for the ſouldiers counting themſelves ſecure of the victory, and thinking they had done a good dayes work already, and beſides being a little hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in drink, and much taken with ſo rich booty, could hardly be brought to leave the Town they had ſo newly taken. And truly before they could be beaten off from the ſpoil, the enemy was come within Musker-ſhot of them. And now (as it uſes to happen in great dangers)
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s counſell of War were of different opinions; ſome perſwaded that <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould ſhiſt for himſelf with the Horſe he had, becauſe they conceived it not poſſible that he ſhould be able to bring off the Foot, who had been wearied with a march of above twenty miles in the morning, after that, were ſpent in a hot fight at noon, and now were overloaden either with drink or prey; eſpecially ſeeing he was to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116000:36"/> or perhaps thirty miles from
<hi>Dundee,</hi> before they could reſt in ſafety. That this was the fortune of War, and to be patiently undergone, eſpecially ſince he had given oft-times far greater overthrows to the enemy than this could be to him. That there was no doubt, but that as long as he was ſafe, his Forces might be eaſily recruited; and on the other ſide, if he miſcarried, the caſe was deſperate, and they were utterly undone. Others cryed out, that all was loſt already, and there was nothing left them but to die with honour; and therefore if charging couragiouſly they ſhould break in amongſt the thickeſt of the enemy, no one could ſay but that they fell gallantly.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> concurred with neither of theſe; for he could never be brought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſo good men as he had in the extremeſt danger, and preferred an honourable death among his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before diſhonourable ſafety. But for all that, for men that were ſo much out-numbred by them to run deſperately upon the enemy, and as it were to daſh out their own brains againſt the ſtones, was the very laſt refuge, and not haſtily to made uſe of; therefore as we ought not to tempt Almighty God by our own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe and negligence, ſo neither ought any valiant man, or good Chriſtian deſpair of his aſſiſtance in a juſt cauſe. Laſtly, he exhorts every one to do his own part, and referre the ſucceſſe to God, and other things to his own care and induſtry.</p>
               <p>Immediately he ſends out four hundred Foot before him, and commands them, that as much as they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could without breaking their ranks they ſhould make all ſpeed. Then he appoints two hundred of the activeſt men he had to follow them; and he with his Horſe brings up his Rear. The Horſe trooped on in ſo open order, that if occaſion were they might have room enough to receive light Muſquetiers. He believed the enemies Foot were not able to overtake them; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116000:37"/> if their Horſe only ſhould charge them (which they would hardly adventure to doe) he conceived it was no matter of extreme difficulty to make their part good againſt them: beſides, the Sun was ready to ſet, and the darkneſſe of the night would be commodious for their retreat. The enemy underſtanding the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that went away firſt by ſome priſoners they had taken, and after that by their own view, aſſoon as they ſaw they were diſpoſed rather for a journey than a battell, divide their Forces into two parts, and ſo purſue them. Wherein their intention was not only to fall upon their Rear and Flank at once, but alſo to ſecure againſt them all paſſages up to the Highlands: And their Commanders the more to encourage their Souldiers to a hot purſuit, propoſed twenty thouſand Crowns to any one that could bring in
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s head. And now the Van of the enemies Horſe began to cloſe up unto the retreaters, whereupon thoſe good Muſquetiers that lined
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Horſe welcommed one, and another, and another of the forwardeſt of them with bullets in their ſides; with whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the reſt becomming more wary, abated of the eagerneſſe of their purſuit. And <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſouldiers when they ſaw they had been too hard for the enemies Foot at a march, and had got before them, taking heart and courage, they skirmiſhed ſtoutly with their Horſe, untill the night parted the quarrell. And to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome way of the enemy, took their way Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward many miles by the ſea-coaſt. However that was not their way, but to goe Northward toward <hi>Granſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baine,</hi> and ſo to deliver themſelves from their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Horſe. But <hi>Baily</hi> had laid the greateſt part of his Army between them and <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> that there might be no place for them to retreat unto.</p>
               <p>Therefore at the dead of the night when they were not far from
<hi>Aberbroth, Montroſe</hi> commands his men to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116000:37"/> make a ſtand a while. And long they ſtood not, before he conſidering with himſelf that all wayes and paſſages ſtraight into the Mountains might be laid by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe (and he was not miſtaken,) commands them to face about, and march South-weſt. And by this art (though with intolerable pains) he beguiled the Purſuers, whom that ſame night he paſſed by; and then turning Northward, by the next morning at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing paſſed over
<hi>South-Eske,</hi> at a place not far from <hi>Careſton</hi> Caſtle: and from thence ſent to <hi>Brechin</hi> to fetch thoſe men which he had there with the Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

Whiles he ſtaid at <hi>Careſton,</hi> the Scouts brought him word on a ſudden, that the enemies Horſe were in ſight, and their Foot being refreſh'd with victuals and ſleep, march'd after them apace.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf being now within three miles of the Mountains was not much afraid of them, but his ſouldiers who had not ſlept for three dayes and two nights, but had all that while been either on their march, or in fight, were overcome with ſo dead ſleep, that they could hardly be raiſed without pricks and wounds.

<hi>Lewis</hi> into their own Country, both that they might recall thoſe whom his brother had ſeduced away, and recruit themſelves by levying new forces. Which hee cheerfully and courageouſly performed, and though he ſpared none, yet he was moſt ſevere with thoſe that had been authoors, or acceſſaries to his brothers defection: and he was the more active in that buſineſſe, that he might acquit himſelf of any ſuſpition. Nor indeed did <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf or any other more deteſt that villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Lewis Gordon,</hi> than that noble Lord his brother. As for
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> he with a ſmall party (for he kept but five hundred Foot, and fifty Horſe with him) marches through <hi>Angus</hi> into
<hi>Pertſhire,</hi> that he might diſtract the enemy till ſuch time as hee made up his Army with recruits from every ſide. Neither was he out in his aim, for the Covenanters had ſent <hi>Hurrey</hi> the Lieutenant Generall of the Horſe, with a Command into the North, of a party of ſix hundred old Foot,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116000:38"/> and two hundred Horſe, that he might ſtrengthen their own ſide, and ſuppreſſe the Lord <hi>Gordon.</hi> And <hi>Baily</hi> himſelf ſtaid with an Army at <hi>Perth,</hi> as in the very heart of the Kingdome, ready to wait upon all motions. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was twelve miles off, at a Village called <hi>Kreif,</hi> where <hi>Baily</hi> underſtood he quartered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely with a very ſmall party: who being diligent upon all occaſions, ſet out from <hi>Perth</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the night with all his Army, that by a ſpeedy march he might at break of day fall unexpected into <hi>Mentroſe</hi>'s quarters. But he found
<hi>Montroſe</hi> carefull enough of his buſineſſe, and his Foot ready in arms, either to march or fight; but he with his Horſe came up towards the enemy to diſcover their number and ſtrength. And when he found them to be two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, he commanded his men to march ſpeedily away, and following the courſe of the river <hi>Erne</hi> to make good the fords thereof: he with the few Horſe that he had was their Rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, leſt they ſhould have been troden in pieces by the enemies Cavalry; And truly he ſo valiantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fierce aſſault of the enemy, that by killing ſome, and routing others, he forced them to a retreat, till at laſt his Foot after ſix miles march had made themſelves Maſters of the paſſes of <hi>Erne.</hi> So the enemy retreated with the loſſe of their labour, and <hi>Montroſe</hi> that ſame night being the Eighteenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> quartered at <hi>Loh-Erne,</hi> and came the next d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Granſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baine,</hi> and marched in great haſte towards the <hi>Spey.</hi> What ſhould <hi>Montroſe</hi> doe in this condition? He muſt of neceſſity either give <hi>Hurrey</hi> battell, or undergoe a far greater hazard of being hemb'd in between two Armies. Therefore he reſolves to try the fortune of War without delay, to commit the ſucceſſe unto God, and chooſing the beſt advantage of ground he could find, there to expect the aſſault of the enemy. There was a little Town that ſtood upon the height which ſhadowed the neighbouring valley; and ſome little h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls that were higher than the Town behind it, that hindered the diſcovery of any one till they were juſt upon him. In this valley he drawes up his Forces out of the view of the enemy. Before the Town he places a few, but expert and choice Foot with his Ordnance, who were ſheltered with ſuch ditches as they found there. The right wing he commits to <hi>Alexander Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donell</hi> with four hundred Foot, and lodged them in places fortified to their hand with banks and ditches, with ſhrubs alſo and great ſtones: and commands him to preſerve himſelf entire, that he might be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon all occaſions, and not to depart from his ſtation which had ſo good a naturall fence, that they might lie there ſafe enough not only from the enemies
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116000:40"/> Horſe but Foot alſo. And with the ſame good advice, he committed to his charge that notable Standard of the Kings, which only he was wont to carry before him; expecting that the enemy upon the ſight of that would order the beſt of their Forces againſt that wing, which by reaſon of the diſadvantage of the place would be rendred wholly unuſefull unto them, till ſuch time as he on the flank ſhould take his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt them. And to that end drawing the reſt of his Forces to the other ſide, he commends the Horſe to the Lord
<hi>Gordon,</hi> and takes charge of the Foot himſelf. Thoſe few that ſtood before the Town under the ſhelter and covert of the banks and ditches, ſeemed as if they were his main battel, wheras indeed he had none. And for reſerves, in that ſcarcity of men they were not to be thought of.</p>
               <p>The enemy (as <hi>Montroſe</hi> moſt wiſely foreſaw) aſſoon as they ſaw the Kings Standard ordered the moſt part of their Horſe and old Souldiers (wherein their chief ſtrength conſiſted) againſt that. And by this time the Van of the enemy began to diſpute it with thoſe before the town and on the right flank, and ſtill as their Souldiers were ſpent, drew up freſh men; which <hi>Montroſe</hi> becauſe his number was but few could not ſo eaſily doe: therefore he reſolved with all his men that he had on the left flank to make a violent aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy at once. And whiles he was thinking ſo to doe there comes unto him one whom he knew to be truſty and diſcreet, and whiſpers him in the ear, that <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with his men on the right flank were put to flight. He being a man of a quick ſpirit, thought it was beſt to foreſtall the Souldiers leſt their hearts ſhould fail them upon bad news, and crys aloud to the Lord <hi>Gordon, My Lord, what doe we doe?</hi> Mac-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>upon the right hand having routed and diſcomfited the enemy is upon the execution; ſhall we ſtand by as idle
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116000:40"/> ſpectatours whiles he carries away the honour of the day?</hi> And with that he commands them to charge.
<hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi>'s Horſe had no mind long to endure the ſhock of the
<hi>Gordons,</hi> but wheeling about, and beginning to run, left their flanks (which they were to maintain) open to their enemies. Their Foot although thus deſerted by their Horſe, being both more in number and better armed than
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men, ſtood out very ſtoutly as long as his men kept aloof; but aſſoon as he came to fall upon them hand to hand, he drove them to throw away their arms, and to ſeek, though to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſave themſelves by their heels. But <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf, not forgetting what was ſignified unto him by ſo faithfull a meſſenger, drew off with a few of his readieſt men unto the right flank, where he found things in a far other condition than they were left.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Mac-donell</hi> being a valiant man, but better at his hands than head, (being over-haſty in battel, and bold even to raſhneſs) diſdaining to ſhelter himſelf behind hedges and ſhrubs whiles the enemy vapoured and provoked him with ill language, contrary to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, upon his own head advanceth towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my out of that moſt defencible faſtneſs and ſtation wherein he was placed. And he did it to his coſt, for the enemy over-powring him both in Horſe and Foot, and having many old ſouldiers amongſt them, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and repulſed his men. And certainly if he had not timely drawn them off into a cloſe hard by, they had every one of them together with the Kings Standard been loſt. But he made amends for that raſh miſtake in his admirable courage in bringing off his men, for he was the laſt man that came off, and covering his body with a great target which he carried in his left hand, defended himſelf againſt the thickeſt of his enemies. Thoſe that came cloſeſt up unto him were Pike-men, who with many a blow had ſtruck their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116000:41"/> ſpear-heads into his target, which he cut off by three or four at once with his ſword which he managed with his right hand. And thoſe that made him any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the cloſe, ſeeing
<hi>Montroſe</hi> come in to his aid, and their own men on the other ſide put to flight, ſuch as were Horſe ſpur'd away, and the Foot (moſt of which were old Souldiers out of <hi>Ireland)</hi> fighting deſperately, were almoſt all of them ſlain upon the ground. The Conquerors purſued them that fled for ſome miles; ſo that there were ſlain about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot of the enemy, amongſt whom their old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fought moſt ſtoutly; but almoſt all their Horſe eſcaped by a more timely than honourable flight.</p>
               <p>Nor had <hi>Hurrey</hi> himſelf with ſome of their beſt men which went laſt off the field eſcaped the hands of the purſuers, had not the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> by I know not what want of heed, diſplayed ſome Enſigns and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards that had been taken from the enemy; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not following the chaſe but turning towards his own party, ſeemed to have been the enemy, and to threaten a new battell. With which miſtake they were ſo long deluded, untill the enemies Horſe, though much diſordered, had ſhifted themſelves away into ſuch by-paths as they knew or could light upon: only a few of them came with <hi>Hurrey</hi> before next morning to <hi>Innerneſſe.</hi> Of ſuch of the enemy as were ſlain, the moſt notable were <hi>Cambell Laver</hi> a Collonel of old Souldiers, Sir
<hi>John</hi> and Sir <hi>Gideon Murray</hi> Knights, and other ſtout men, and perhaps not unworthy to be lamented, had they not ſtained their otherwiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable valour with the horrid crime of Rebellion; nor in that did they ſo much follow their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the humour of the times, or the ambition, or avarice of their Chiefs. <hi>Montroſe</hi> of thoſe that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with him on the left flank miſſed only one man, and him a private ſouldier; and on that ſide where
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116000:41"/> 
                  <hi>Mac-donell</hi> commanded, there were miſſing fourteen private ſouldiers alſo. But he had many more wounded, the curing and ſecuring of whom was eſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by
<hi>Montroſe.</hi> Afterwards entertaining the priſoners with ſweetneſs and courteſie, he promiſed all ſuch as repented of their errour, liberty or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and was as good as his word, and ſuch as were obſtinate in their rebellion he diſpoſed of into ſeverall priſons. In this battell at <hi>Alderne,</hi> the valour of young <hi>Napier</hi> did very much diſcover it ſelf; who being the ſon of the Lord <hi>Napier</hi> of
<hi>Marchiſton,</hi> and <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s nephew by his ſiſter, had but a little before without the knowledge of his father, or wife, ſtoln away from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to his uncle, and did at this time give an excellent aſſay of his valour, and laid down moſt firme principles of a moſt noble diſpoſition. Whereupon the chief of the Covenanters took his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a man almoſt threeſcore and ten years old (and as good a man as ever
<hi>Scotland</hi> bred in this age,) and his wife, the daughter of the Earl of

This battell was fought at

Afterward paſſing over the <hi>Spey</hi> he came to <hi>Keith,</hi> from thence to
<hi>Frendrackt,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Strathbogy.</hi> Here <hi>Baily</hi> meets him (unto whom <hi>Hurrey</hi> with thoſe that remained of his broken Troops at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne</hi> was joyned) and provokes him to battell.
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> kept back his men, who were ſpent with great travail, and were far ſewer both in Horſe and Foot, though very eager to fight, till ſuch time as hee had raiſed new forces, and recruited them. Therefore thinking it enough to maintain that ground which he had choſen as commodiouſly as he could for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf untill night, paſſeth then to
<hi>Balveny,</hi> whither alſo the enemy followeth him: but he paſſing by
<hi>Strath-done</hi> and <hi>Strath-Spey,</hi> went up to <hi>Badenoth.</hi> The enemy getting to the other ſide of the water provokes him again to fight; but in vain, for he was very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of giving them a ſet battell, but nevertheleſs by frequent skirmiſhes, and eſpecially beating up quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the night, did ſo much weaken their power and courage, that they that were ſo haughtily da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but a while agoe, as well Commanders as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, haſtily and diſorderly betook themſelves by night to <hi>Innerneſs</hi> when none purſued them. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was not much diſpleaſed that he was ſo rid of this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, eſpecially for this reaſon; the Earl of
<hi>Lindſey,</hi> the prime ringleader of the Covenanters next unto
<hi>Argyle,</hi> and his rivall too (as being brother-in-law to Duke

                  <hi>Hamilton)</hi> uſed to give out, that
<hi>Argyle</hi> wanted either care or courage; and howſoever it came to paſs, was ſtill unfortunate. And therefore he took upon himſelf the command of that Army which was newly raiſed, as if he would aſſay to manage the buſineſs with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conduct. And now he had paſſed over with his forces into <hi>Angus,</hi> intending to be a reſerve unto

<hi>Lindſey</hi> (who lay yet in <hi>Angus</hi> at a Caſtle called
<hi>Newtill)</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Generall was no ſouldier, and the ſouldiers raw, and unacquainted with the hardſhip of War.</p>
               <p>In purſuit of which deſign, departing from
<hi>Bade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth</hi> he marcheth through the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> over
<hi>Gransbaine,</hi> and came by long and painfull journies unto the coaſt of the river of <hi>Airley,</hi> intending to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the enemy on a ſudden: which was eaſie to be done, for he had made ſuch haſt, that the news of his approach was not ſo ſwift as himſelf. And now
<hi>Lindſey</hi> was not above ſeven miles from him, and all things were ready for an aſſault, when (upon what occaſion it is uncertain) almoſt all the Northern men privately ran away from their colours; and going back the way that they came, return into their Country. The Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was in the Camp, and there was none there that deteſted that villaay with greater indignation than he, in ſo much that <hi>Montroſe</hi> had much adoe to with-hold him from putting ſuch of the fugitives to death as had any dependance upon him. Some ſtick not to ſay, that, theſe men were inveigled away by the private directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his father the Marqueſs of

               <p>Therefore taking up new reſolutions, he followeth after Collonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> a valiant man and a truſty, and welbeloved in his Country, whom he had ſent before. And by this time

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116000:43"/> along with him a conſiderable number of Horſe; whom his brother the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> had much adoe afterward to draw back to their colours. In the mean time <hi>Lindſey</hi> took a thouſand old Souldiers from <hi>Baily,</hi> and gave him as many raw and new rais'd men for them; and as if hee intended to doe ſome famous exploit, returning through <hi>Merne</hi> into <hi>Angus,</hi> with all the pains he took he did only this, he ranged with his Army up and down <hi>Athole,</hi> and after he had robbed and ſpoiled all the Countrey, he ſet it on fire. In this imitating <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was the firſt that in this age introduced that cruell and dreadfull preſident of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying houſes and corn: being better at fire than ſword, when they came into empty fields and towns unmann'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baily</hi> at that time went to <hi>Bogy,</hi> to beſiege the faireſt caſtle that belonged to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntly,</hi> and indeed of all the North; and in caſe he failed to take it in, to waſte and fire all the Country of the <hi>Gordons</hi> thereabouts.
<hi>Montroſe</hi> (although <hi>Mac-donel</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with a great party) thought it neceſſary to relieve <hi>Huntley</hi> and his friends, whom he laboured to aſſure unto himſelf by all good offices, and hied thither. Where having notice that <hi>Baily</hi>'s ſouldiers, though not all, yet a great part, were new rais'd men (for he had parted with ſo many old ſouldiers to <hi>Lindſey)</hi> deſired nothing more than without delay to fight him, and marcheth ſtraight towards him. He had not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three miles before he diſcovered the enemies Scouts: He therefore ſent before ſome of his readieſt men that knew the wayes to view the ſtrength, the rendezvouz, and the order of the enemy. They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly bring word, that the Foot ſtood on the top of a hill ſome two miles off; and the Horſe had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed themſelves of a narrow and troubleſome paſſe which lay almoſt in the middle between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116000:44"/> and were come on this ſide it. Againſt them <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſent ſuch Horſe as he had in a readineſs, with ſome nimble Firelocks, whom they firſt entertained with light skirmiſhes afar-of, and after retreated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the paſs, which they had ſtrongly mann'd with muſquetiers. <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſends for the Foot, that if it were poſſible they might diſlodge the enemy from thence; but it could not be done, for they were parted by the fall of the night, which both ſides paſſed over, waking and in their arms. The next day <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſends a Trumpet to offer a ſet battell, but <hi>Baily</hi> anſwers, he would not receive order to fight from an enemy. He therefore ſeeing he could not drive the enemy from thoſe paſſes without manifeſt loſs and danger, that he might draw him out thence in ſome time, marcheth off to
<hi>Pithlurge,</hi> and from thence to a Caſtle of the Lord
<hi>Forbeſes</hi> called <hi>Druminore,</hi> where he ſtaid two dayes. And at laſt he underſtands the enemy had quitted the paſſes, and was marching toward <hi>Strathbogy;</hi> ſo he at break of day ſets forth towards a village called <hi>Alford.</hi> But <hi>Baily</hi> when he had gotten certain notice that <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with a conſiderable part of thoſe Force: was abſent in the Highlands, he voluntarily purſues
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> conceiving him to be ſtealing away, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noon began to face him. <hi>Montroſe</hi> determines to wait for the enemy (who as ſeemed to him came towards him) upon the higer ground: but <hi>Baily</hi> turning aſide ſome three miles to the left hand, <hi>Montroſe</hi> holds on his intended march to <hi>Alford,</hi> where he ſtaid that night, the enemy lying about four miles off.</p>
               <p>The next day after, <hi>Montroſe</hi> commands his men very early in the morning to ſtand to their armes, and make ready to battell, and placed them on a hill that ſtands over <hi>Alford.</hi> And as he with a Troop of Horſe was obſerving the motion and order of the enemy, and viewing the fords of the <hi>Done,</hi> a river
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116000:44"/> which runs by <hi>Alford,</hi> it was told him that the enemy, Horſe and Foot, were making unto a ford which lay a mile from <hi>Alford,</hi> to the intent that they might cut off the Rear of their flying enemy; for ſo thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diviners propheſied to their deſtruction. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> leaving that troop of Horſe not far from the Ford, together with ſome ſelect and underſtanding men who ſhould give him perfect intelligence of all things, he returneth alone to order the battell. And above all things he poſſeſſes himſelf of <hi>Alford</hi> hill, where he might receive the charge of the enemy if they fell on deſperately. Behind him was a mooriſh place full of ditches and pits, which would prevent Horſe falling upon his Rear: before him was a ſteep hill which kept his men from the enemies view, ſo that they could hardly perceive the formoſt ranks. He had ſcarce given order for the right managing of all things, when thoſe Horſe whom he had left at the Ford returned with a full cariere, and bring word that the enemy had paſſed the River. And now it was no more ſafe for either of them to retreat without the apparent ruine of their party. It is reported that <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> like a skilfull and wary Commander, was ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will drawn unto this battell; nor had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, had he not been neceſſitated unto it by the raſhneſs of the Lord <hi>Balcariſe,</hi> a Collonel of Horſe; who precipitated himſelf and the Horſe under his command into that danger, whether <hi>Baily</hi> would or no, as that he could not be brought off without the hazard of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> gave the command of his right wing (on which ſide the enemies Horſe were moſt ſtrong) unto the Lord <hi>Gordon;</hi> and appointed <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> an old Commander, to his aſſiſtance. The command of the left wing was given to the Earl of

The numbers of the Foot were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner even, either ſide had about two thouſand: but <hi>Baily</hi> was much ſtronger in Horſe, for he had ſix hundred, and <hi>Montroſe</hi> but two hundred and fifty.

<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> had this advantage, that the enemy were for the moſt part hirelings raiſed from dunghils, but thoſe that ſerved the King, Gentlemen, who fought for a good Cauſe and Honour, <hi>gratis,</hi> and not for gain; and ſuch as eſteem'd it more becomming to die than to be overcome. Beſides <hi>Montroſe</hi> knew that the greateſt part of the old ſouldiers were gone with <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and the now ones would be ſo frighted with the ſhouts of the Armies, and the noiſe of Trumpets, that they would ſcarce ſtand the firſt charge.

The firſt that made way for themſelves and their men by a great flaughter of their enemies were the two <hi>Gordons,</hi> the Lord and the Collonel; and Collonel

<hi>Aboine</hi> with the left wing kept off, nor did he attempt the enemy but by light skirmiſhes in ſmall parties: who when they ſaw their own men on their left wing routed and put to flight, made their retreat with little loſſe.

<hi>Aberdene)</hi> to haſten unto him into <hi>Merne</hi> with ſuch Forces as he heard he had raiſed. <hi>Aboine</hi> came indeed, but brought no great ſtore of Forces along with him; therefore he ſends him back into the North to raiſe as many men as he could poſſibly, and bring them with all ſpeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp. Hee himſelf going through <hi>Angus,</hi> met his Coſen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> with his <hi>Athole-</hi>men ready to live and die under his command, and <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with a great power of Highlanders: with him was <hi>Macklen,</hi> the chief of his ſept, a valiant man, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly loyall, who brought ſome ſeven hundred choiſe Foot of his friends and clients.

<hi>Montroſe,</hi> (ſeeing he in perſon almoſt from the Expedition into

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he daily expected <hi>Aboine</hi> and <hi>Airley</hi> to come unto him with a conſiderable party of Horſe, he paſſed over the <hi>Tay</hi> at
<hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> and lying neer <hi>Amunde,</hi> ſtruck no ſmall terrour into the enemy who held Saint <hi>Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town;</hi> and from thence approaching neerer unto them, he encamped in <hi>Methfyn</hi> Forreſt.</p>
               <p>The enemies Foot (all but the garriſon ſouldiers in the Town) lay on the South of the river <hi>Erne.</hi> The Horſe which were deſigned for the guard of the Town
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116000:48"/> and Parliament aſſoon as they diſcovered <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Scouts, bring in a hot alarm that he was there, and come already cloſe to the gates, and no queſtion but he meant preſently to ſcale the walls, and make an aſſault upon the Town: therefore they were earneſt with the Nobility, and the whole Parliament, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a ſpeedy flight: when all this while
<hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſcarce a hundred Horſe, and they were four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. But he the next day the more to encreaſe their terrour, drew neerer unto the Town with thoſe Horſe he had, and about the ſame number of ready Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks whom he mounted upon pack-horſes; and ſet out his men in their view ſo much to his advantage, that they appeared a conſiderable body of Horſe. And becauſe the enemy kept themſelves within the gates, forthwith turning towards <hi>Duplen,</hi> he diligently view'd this ſide of the River
<hi>Erne,</hi> and all that coaſt, as if he had Horſe enough to keep all that Country in ſubjection. And truly thus much he got by it, that the enemy took him to be exceeding ſtrong as well in Horſe as Foot. Therefore they draw together as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forces from all ſides, as they could make; whom they intended to fight with <hi>Montroſe,</hi> if he ſhould offer to paſſe over the <hi>Forth,</hi> But he finding it not ſafe for himſelf, neither to deſcend into the champain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they both kept their ſtations for many dayes, the enemie expecting Auxiliaries out of <hi>Fife,</hi> and the Country on this ſide the <hi>Forth,</hi> and out of the Weſt; and
<hi>Montroſe</hi> looking for the like out of the North. And waiting impatiently for <hi>Aboine</hi> who was too ſlow with his men, he ſent ſome to haſten him, leſt they ſhould loſe the opportunity of doing their buſineſſe. He alſo complained, but in a ſoft and gentle manner, as before a faithfull friend, that <hi>Aboine</hi>'s lingring and delay was in the fault, that a brave victory, by which he conceived the Rebells might have been utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116000:48"/> had ſlipt out of his hands; which misfortune no man doubted, but his ſpeed and diligence might have prevented.</p>
               <p>The enemy when they underſtood that he onely cheated them with a falſe Muſter of Horſe, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aid from all parts, and by this time over-numbring him even in Foot, labour'd not only to provoke, but even compell him to fight. Whereupon he concluded to ſtep aſide a little into the neighbouring Mountains, whither he knew either the enemy would not advance, or if they did, it would be to their loſſe. Therefore the enemy drawing neer with all their Army to <hi>Methſyn,</hi> he gives a private command for the Carriages to drive faſt up the hills, whiles he, as if he intended to fight, orders the battell, makes good the paſſes with ſtrong guards, and draws up the Horſe into the Front. Nor did the enemy expect any other than to try it out by battell, which he made as if he would give, till ſuch time as the Carriages were got ſo farre before, that he conceiv'd them out of danger: and then he commands the Army in one body at their cloſe order to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way apace: He gave charge unto ſuch Horſe as hee had, and his ableſt Fire-locks to bring up the Rear, and to ſecure them from the enemies Horſe. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my providing for a preſent charge, as they expected, when they ſaw
<hi>Montroſe</hi> retreating, firſt purſued ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly though to no purpoſe; for he making good all paſſes as he went, eaſily repulſed them, and without loſſe of ſo much as one private ſouldier, came cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oft into the heights and ſleep places that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible unto the enemies Horſe, and for their Foot they fear'd no aſſault from them. It is remarkable, that when <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Horſe were come up unto the paſſes, and the enemy knew very well they were not able to purſue any further; leſt with all that pains they ſhould ſeem to have done nothing at all, they ſent out
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116000:49"/> three hundred of their ableſt and readieſt Horſe to follow after them with a great ſhout and baſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; whom, when <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſaw, he call'd for only twenty active bodied men of the Highlanders that were uſed to hunting, and very good marks-men, and commanded them to check their inſolence: and they firſt of all creeping hither, and thither, and hiding their guns, took their aims ſo well, that they knockt down ſome of the forwardeſt of thoſe men; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of the better ſort, by their example made the reſt more wary, ſo that they were all contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. But thoſe good huntſmen being encouraged with their good ſucceſs, aſſoon as they ſaw their enemies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd, came into the open plain, and reſolutely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Horſe: who, in as much fear as Bucks or Does chaſed by Hunters, ſet ſputs to their Horſes, &amp; fled back to their main body as if the Devill were in them.</p>
               <p>The enemy upon their retreat choſe that place for their Rendezvouz, from whence <hi>Montroſe</hi> departed, <hi>Methfyn</hi> Forreſt: after they had done nothing worthy to be remembred in all that expedition, but that when they found themſelves unable to cope with men, they exerciſed their cruelty upon women: for all the wives of the Iriſh and Highlanders that they light of, (who followed the Camp for the love of their husbands) moſt baſely and ſhameleſly they hew'd in pieces.
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> kept his quarters at little <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> both becauſe the place was cumberſome and unpaſſable for Horſe, and lay very conveniently for receiving ſuch aids as he daily expected with
<hi>Aboine</hi> out of the North. All which time the two ſpleenative Armies lying cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether rather ſtood upon their guards than offered any affront one to the other.</p>
               <p>And now at length <hi>Aboine,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniell Gordon</hi> brought up their men out of the <hi>North</hi> to
<hi>Dunkeldon;</hi> men for their number indeed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116000:49"/> fewer than was expected, but for their ſtoutneſs and true valour farre above their number. The Horſe they brought were only two hundred, and ſome ſixſcore Firelocks whom they had mounted and made Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons: other Foot they brought none. Along with them came the Earle of <hi>Airley</hi> and Sir <hi>David</hi> his Son, with fourſcore Horſe, moſt of them of the noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Oglebyes;</hi> amongſt whom <hi>Alexander</hi> Son and heir of Sir <hi>John Ogleby</hi> of
<hi>Innarcarit</hi> was moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, not only for the rare accompliſhments of his perſon, and the ſplendor of his Anceſtors, but for the honour of his valiant and happy atchievements, much above what his age could promiſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> being thus well recruited, thought it not good to loſe any time, but marched ſtraight towards the enemy. But aſſoon as he came to <hi>Amunde,</hi> he thought it beſt to ſee in what condition the enemy was, and to find out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was true which he had receiv'd a flying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of; that was, that very many of their Auxiliaries had deſerted their colours and run home. Therefore leaving his Foot to take their reſt, a little before night he fac'd the enemy with his Horſe; with which ſight being ſomething affrighted, they kept within their trenches. And next morning early <hi>Montroſe</hi> riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to diſcover, was informed that they had ſtollen away at the dead of the night to <hi>Methfyn,</hi> and in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had got over a bridge upon the <hi>Erne.</hi> He inſtantly cauſes his men to march, and paſſing the river at a ſtone-bridge about ſix miles off, lay that night in <hi>Strath-Erne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>FIfe</hi> is the moſt populous, the moſt rich, the thickeſt Country of Towns and villages in all <hi>Scotland.</hi> Its inhabitants are little martiall, conſiſting moſt of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Shop-keepers, Mariners, and Husbandmen. But ſo new-fangled in their Religion, and ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both by the example and authority of the Nobility, and by the Sermons of their ſeditious Miniſters, that all of them upon the matter were extremely addicted to the Covenanters. The Country it ſelf is almoſt an Iland, bein inviron'd towards the South with the Scotiſh <hi>Fyrth,</hi> on the North with the <hi>Tay,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth ſhips of great burden all along; on the Eaſt with the main ſea. No entrance thither by land but on the Weſt, in the ſtraights of which both Armies lay. The whole Country was in a diſtraction, ſome (eſpecially their much-admired Preachers that thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred nothing but Excommunications) inciting and compelling all of every eſtate and age to take up armes; others flocking in great numbers unto them; others running hither and thither to hide themſelves, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was led by his own ſuperſtition, confidence, or fear. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was very deſirous to aſſault the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and try the fortune of a battell with them before they encreas'd their Forces with addition of the <hi>Fife-</hi>men; but it would not be. For they had ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelves by the advantage of the ground, and the narrowneſſe of the paſſages, that he could by no meanes either make his way unto them, or draw them out into plainer ground. Having therefore made them ſeverall fruitleſſe offers of battell, he reſolved to march into the heart of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and came to
<hi>Kinroſs,</hi> as well to hinder the riſing of that Country, as to train the enemy at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116000:50"/> laſt out of their faſtneſſe to come in unto the aide of of their diſtreſſed friends. They, not ſo much as dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall upon his Reat, turn'd another way, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping cloſe to the bank firſt of the <hi>Erne,</hi> afterwards of the <hi>Tay,</hi> made ſpeed towards the Eaſt-ſide of the Country. As <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſed along, he ſent Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> before him with a ſmall party. Theſe ſending the reſt of their party up and down to ſcout, kept only ten men in their company: on a ſudden they happened upon two hundred of the enemy who were raiſing men in thoſe parts, and being not able to retreat, they twelve encountred the two hundred, put them to flight, kill'd ſome, and took other ſome priſoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> that night came to <hi>Kinroſſe,</hi> not doubting but they of <hi>Fife</hi> who were exceedingly out of love with the King, moſt firm to the Covenanters, and wholly given to the new ſuperſtition, were generally up in armes. Therefore thinking it not ſafe raſhly to engage with ſo great a multitude of Horſe and Foot, he determin'd to paſſe over the <hi>Forth;</hi> and that upon this ground, that he having wearied out the <hi>Fife-</hi>men (whom he beleev'd would not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſwaded to follow the Army further than their own borders) with long marches, might vanquiſh them without a blow. For he accounted that moſt of them being born or brought up in ſhops, or ſhips, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and not acquainted with the hardſhip of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, would preſently give out and be weary. Beſides ſuch of the Nobility as were in rebellion (after they ſaw with ſorrow that the ſeat of the War was drawn ſo near them as the <hi>Forth)</hi> were raiſing men with more eagerneſſe than ever before upon the Borders and in the Weſt; of whom the chief were the Earls of
<hi>Lane rick, Caſſils,</hi> and <hi>Eglington.</hi> Whoſe levies
<hi>Montroſe</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured either to hinder, or draw themſelves to his ſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116000:51"/> they came up to <hi>Baily</hi> and the
<hi>Fife-men;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he marched from <hi>Kinroſs,</hi> towards
<hi>Sterling,</hi> and lay that night ſome three miles from the City. The next day ſending the Foot before, he followed ſoftly after with the Horſe, becauſe he ſuſpected that the enemy purſued him in the Rear.</p>
               <p>Nor was he deceived in that ſuſpition, for ſome Eſpyalls whom he left behind him brought word that <hi>Baily</hi> was hard by with the greateſt Army that ever he had. And immediately the enemies Scouts came within view, one of whom having been too forward, was brought priſoner to
<hi>Montroſe</hi> by ſome of his Horſe. He being examined told them freely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidently that he beleeved <hi>Baily</hi> and his party were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to march all that night to engage him to fight aſſoon as was poſſible, before they diſmiſt the <hi>Fife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who being already tir'd he hardly beleev'd would be drawn over the <hi>Forth,</hi> accounting their work at an end aſſoon as the enemy was gone out of their own Country. Therefore <hi>Montroſe,</hi> that he might get ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily over the
<hi>Forth,</hi> bid his men march apace, and going on the other ſide of
<hi>Sterling</hi> (a good Town, and one of the Kings ſtrongeſt Caſtles, in which the enemy had now a great Garriſon) that ſame night paſſed over the river at a Ford about four miles above the Town. And at break of day next morning made a halt a while about ſix miles from <hi>Sterling:</hi> where he had intelligence, that the enemy the night before had not come over the <hi>Forth,</hi> but quartered three miles from <hi>Sterling</hi> on the other ſide of the river. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> holding on his intended journey, encamped himſelf in that fatall place, the Field of
<hi>Kilſythe.</hi> He bids the ſouldiers to refreſh themſelves, but however to be in a readineſſe either to fight or march, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould ſerve. The enemy the meane while by an eaſier and ſhorter cut got over the <hi>Forth</hi> at <hi>Sterling</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:116000:51"/> bridge, and encamped at night ſome three miles from <hi>Kilſythe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the interim, the Earle of <hi>Lanerick</hi> Duke
<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s brother had rais'd a thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe of the friends and clients of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> in
<hi>Cluidſdale</hi> and the places adjacent, and was not at preſent above twelve miles from <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſythe.</hi> And the Earls of <hi>Caſſils, Eglington,</hi> and <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne,</hi> with others of the Covenanting Nobility, were engaging the Weſt unto the ſame impious <hi>Mililia;</hi> who were ſo much the readier to take up armes, by how much they had leſſe felt the miſeries of Warre. Which things being well conſidered,
<hi>Montroſe</hi> thought it beſt to fight with thoſe Forces which
<hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> had at preſent. For although they were more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than his own, yet the danger was like to be greater of his ſide, if he ſhould be put to engage with them when <hi>Lanericks</hi> and other parties were come up. But moreover he was either obliged to take this courſe or do nothing, and return back into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands with the blemiſh of that Honour which by ſo many victories he had atchiev'd. The enemy on the other ſide being arrogant, and confiding in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their men, beleev'd that <hi>Montroſe</hi> had but made a running march the dayes before, and had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the
<hi>Forth</hi> more out of fear than deſigne, ſo that they counted it nothing to aſſault him in that ground and entrenchment which he had choſen to his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And above all, their proud hopes were moſt carefull of this, to block up all wayes of his eſcape, and to prevent his return into the Mountains. But there are ſome that ſay, <hi>Baily</hi> himſelf thought it not beſt to give him battell, but was over-ſway'd by the authority and votes of the Earl of <hi>Linſey</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſome other of the Nobility that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Army, which forc't him much againſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:116000:52"/> to draw up his men, and order the battell as he could. However it was, early in the morning they led their men ſtraight upon <hi>Montroſe:</hi> which when he ſaw, he told the ſtanders by that that was happen'd which he moſt deſired, for now he could ſupply his want of men by the advantage of the ground; and therefore he made haſte to poſſeſſe himſelf of the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes before them. Moreover he commands all his men, as well Horſe as Foot, to throw off their doublets, and to affront the enemy all in white, being naked unto the waſte all but their ſhirts: which when they had chearfully performed, they ſtood there provided and ready to fight, reſolved certainly either to conquer or die.</p>
               <p>In the field where they intended to fight there were ſome Cottages and Country-gardens, where <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> had conveniently lodg'd ſome few men; and the firſt deſigne of the enemy was to diſlodge them. But it took not; for making a fierce aſſault, and being as ſtoutly receiv'd, aſſoon as they were obſerv'd to cool ſomething of their firſt heat, thoſe that mann'd the places beat them off, drave them away, and ſlew them without reſiſtance. The Highlanders being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with this happy ſucceſſe, thoſe that were next thoſe places not expecting the word of Command, ran raſhly up the hill which lay open to the whole ſtrength of the enemy. <hi>Montroſe,</hi> although he was ſomething troubled at the unſeaſonable boldneſſe of his men, yet thought it not good to leave them engaged; nor was it eaſie to ſay, whether the quickneſſe of his relief, or the cowardlineſſe of the enemy, conduc'd more to their ſafety. <hi>Montroſe</hi> had in all four thouſand four hundred Foot, and five hundred Horſe; a thouſand of his Foot or more had now by their own fault ſo engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the enemy that they could not come off, or the enemy encounter'd them with ſix thouſand
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116000:52"/> Foot and eight hundred Horſe. But the enemies Rear came up but ſlowly, and while the Van made a ſtand expecting their advance, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bring timely aid to his engaged men. But at laſt they ſend out three troops of Horſe, and after them two thouſand Foot againſt thoſe raſh and almoſt loſt men of
<hi>Montroſe's.</hi> Which when <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſaw (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others had too diſhonourably ſhifted off that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) he thus beſpeaks the Earle of <hi>Airley, You ſee</hi> (my noble Lord) <hi>how yonder men of ours by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedneſſe have brought themſelves into a moſt deſperate hazard, and will preſently be trampled to dirt by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe, except we relieve them with all ſpeed: Now all mens eyes and hearts are fixt upon your Lordſhip, they think you only worthy ſo great an honour as to repell the enemy, and bring off our fellow ſouldiers. Beſides, it ſeemes moſt proper for you, that the errour which hath been committed by the fool hardineſſe of youth, may be corrected by your Lordſhips grave and diſercet valour.</hi> And he undertook the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (as dangerous as it was) with all his heart, and being guarded with a troop of Horſe, (in which rode <hi>Iohn Ogleby</hi> of <hi>Baldeby,</hi> who had formerly been a Collonel in <hi>Swethland,</hi> a ſtout man, and a ſkilfull ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier) led them on ſtraight upon the enemy. And they giving the charge upon the
<hi>Ogleby's,</hi> diſputed it ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them for a while, but at laſt being no longer able to withſtand their courage, fac'd about: whom the
<hi>Ogleby's</hi> purſued ſo hotly, that they made them fall foul upon their own Foot; and (charging them furiouſly thorough and thorough) routed them and trode them under foot. By this gallant example of <hi>Airley</hi> and the <hi>Ogleby's, Montroſe's</hi> ſouldiers being enrag'd more and more could no longer be kept back from raiſing a great ſhout (as if they had already got the day) and falling on upon the enemy. Nor would the Rebells Horſe long abide their charge, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116000:53"/> their Foot, fell a running as faſt as ever they could: Nor did their Foot after they were ſo deſerted ſtand it out long, but throwing down their arms, ſought to ſave their lives by flight. Which proved unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the victorious purſuers had the killing of them for fourteen miles: So that of all the enemies foot that were preſent at that battell, it is thought there did not an hundred come off. Nor did their Horſe eſcape very well, of whom ſome were killed, ſome taken, the reſt diſperſt. Their Ordinance, their Arms, their Spoils came clearly to the Conquerours, who loſt only ſix of their ſide; whereof three were
<hi>Oglebyes,</hi> valiant Gentlemen, who fighting like themſelves, ſcald the victory with their own bloud. The rebellious ſort of the Nobility (of whom many were in the fight) ſome of them by their timous running and ſwiftneſſe of their Horſes got to the Town and ſtrong Caſtle of
<hi>Sterling;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſcaping to the <hi>Scotiſh Fyrth</hi> ſhipt themſelves in ſome veſſels that lay at anchor near the ſhore: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom <hi>Argyle</hi> (having now this third time been fortunate to a boat) eſcaped into a ſhip; and thought himſelf ſcarce ſafe enough ſo, till weighing anchor he got into the main. Of priſoners, the chief were Sir <hi>William Murray</hi> of <hi>Blebe, James Arnot</hi> brother to the Lord
<hi>Burghley,</hi> one Collonel <hi>Dice,</hi> and Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Wallies,</hi> beſides many more, whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> after quarter given uſed courteouſly, and upon the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Honours ſet at liberty. And this is that famous victory of <hi>Kilſythe,</hi> obtained on the 15 day of
<hi>September</hi> 1645. in which it is beleev'd no fewer than ſix thouſand Rebells were ſlain.</p>

And Cities and Countries that were furtheſt off began to diſpatch their Commiſſioners to profeſſe in their names their Allegiance to their King, their duty and ſervice to his Vicegerent, and freely to offer him men, arms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and other neceſſaries of War. The Nobility of the Realm, and the Chiefs of Septs came in thick unto the Lord Governour, welcomed him, tendred their ſervice unto him, extoll'd his high and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble atchievements, and thank't him for them. All whom he pardoned for what was paſt, receiv'd them with liberty and indempnity into his protection, and encouraged them to be of good chear.
<hi>Nor did he lay any greater burden upon them, than to change that covetous and cruell ſlavery which they were manacled with by the Rebels, for the ſweet and gentle government and protection of a moſt gracious Prince; and by laying aſide all former grudges and fewds, hereafter more religiouſly to obſerve their duty and loyalty to the good King; and thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward never more to have to doe with the counſells of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116000:54"/> men, who by endeavouring to ſatisfie their own luſts, had engaged King and Subject one againſt the other, and upon the matter ruin'd both. For his part he never had any other intention, than to reſtore their Religion, their King, their Liberty, his Peers and Countrymen, by Armes (when no other means was left) out of the tyranny of Rebels, unto their antient peace, happineſſe, and glory. Which if he ſhould effect, he would give Almighty God the authour of all good things everlaſting praiſe; but if he failed, however he ſhould by theſe his honeſt endeavours acquit himſelf before God, and Gods Vicegerent his Majeſty; before all good men, and his poſterity, his honour and his conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the whole Kingdom ſounded nothing but
<hi>Montroſe's</hi> praiſe. Men of all ſorts every where extolling the ingenuity of his diſpoſition in which he out went all his Equalls; the gallantry of his perſon in Warre, his patience in travels, his evenneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in dangers, his wiſdome in counſels, his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſuch as ſubmitted, his quickneſſe in diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his courteſie to ſuch as he took priſoners, in a word, his truly heroick vertue in all things, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men. And this honour moſt men gave him in good carneſt, and out of a ſincere affection, but ſome in craft and diſſimulation; and as every one had wit or skil they ſet forth his
<hi>Encomiums</hi> or <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in Vetſe or Proſe. Yea ſuch is the volubility or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, and the inconſtancy of the whirling mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that they were not affraid openly to curſe and rail at the ringleaders and prime men of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters Faction, ſuch as <hi>Argyle, Lindſey, Loudon,</hi> and other, (whom a while agoe they honoured and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Saints) as authors of all the miſchiefs that had befaln them.</p>
               <p>All things going on thus happily, the Northern parts of the Kingdome being ſecured on his back, the way being opened unto him into the South, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116000:54"/> of the Rebells every where quaſh'd, their chief lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (who in conſcience of their guilt deſpaired of mercy) driven out of the Kingdome, and no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable party remaining in armes; yet in the Weſt there were ſome ſtirres. For the Earls of <hi>Caſſils</hi> and <hi>Egling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and ſome other promoters of the Covenanters Cauſe, laboured to engage the Countries in a new War, and were ſaid to have rais'd in a tumultuary way the number of four thouſand men. Therefore
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> the next day after the battell of <hi>Kilſythe</hi> drew his men into <hi>Cluidſdale,</hi> from whence the Earle of
<hi>Lanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> being ſtruck with the news of their late over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, disbanding thoſe men that he had rais'd, was fled. <hi>Montroſe</hi> choſe that quarter as lying moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly for his affaires in the South and Weſt; and matched to <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> which is the principall city of that Countrey. He receiv'd the Town into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and entring into it with the joyfull acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, firſt of all he reſtrained his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from plunder, and then being ſevere againſt the delinquents, for the terrour of others, he put ſome of the chiefeſt incendiaries of them to death. After that in favour of the Citizens, the next day after he came, he departed the Town and quartered at <hi>Bothwell.</hi> Where becauſe it was but ſix miles from the City, leſt the Citizens ſhould be prejudiced by the inſolence of the ſouldiers, he gave them leave to ſtand upon their guard, and defend the City with a Garriſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Hoping with ſuch acts of clemency to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage not only the men of <hi>Glaſcow</hi> unto himſelf, but the inhabitants of other Cities alſo, by good offices more than by force and armes.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Boihwell</hi> he ſtand many dayes, where he received the perſonall addreſſes of ſome of the Nobility, and of others by their Truſtees, Friends, and Meſſengers; and ſetled the peace of Towns and Countries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116000:55"/> who all willingly ſubmitted themſelves. The chief of the inhabitants of thoſe parts who came to wellcome him, and offer their ſervice, were the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Douglaſſe,</hi> a man of a moſt noble family and chief of the <hi>Douglaſſes,</hi> the Earls of
<hi>Limmuck, Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and <hi>Hortfield;</hi> the Lord Barons of
<hi>Seton, Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Fleming, Maderty, Carnegy,</hi> and <hi>Jonſton; Hamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Orbeſton, Charter of Hempsſield, Toures</hi> of

               <p>After the victory of <hi>Kilſythe</hi> no thoughts had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place in <hi>Montroſe's</hi> noble breaſt, than the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch priſoners as for no other fault but the ſin of Loyalty had been moſt baſely uſed, and ſtill expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, in the grievous and filthy gaole of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> Therefore he ſends his nephew <hi>Napier</hi> with Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon</hi> and a commanded party of Horſe to
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to ſummon the City and receive it upon ſurrender, to ſot the priſoners at liberty, and to ſettle the Town in peace and loyalty; but in caſe they ſtood out and refuſed to ſubmit, to threaten them with fire and ſword. They aſſoon as they came within four miles of the Town made a ſtand, (and intended to come no nearer, unleſſe they chanced to be forced unto it by the obſtinacy of the Citizens,) as well that at that diſtance they might the more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the unrulineſſe of the ſouldier, leſt they ſhould wrong the poor inhabitants, and in their ſury reduce that curſed City, which had been the cauſe and ſomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the Rebellion, into aſhes, which <hi>Montroſe</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:116000:55"/> gave them eſpecially in charge by all means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; as alſo to preſerve the Army ſafe from the plague, which was hot in the City and places adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and whereof very many dyed every day. Aſſoon as ever the news of their approach was brought unto the Town, they all began to tremble and deſpair of their lives; and to raiſe a cry as if the ſwords were already at their throats, or their houſes in a flame. Not a few of them being pricked in their guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiences, freely and openly accus'd themſelves for the moſt ungratefull, traiterous, ſactilegious and perjured perſons in the world, and unworthy of any mercy. Then applying themſelves unto the priſoners they had, both calling unto them a far off, and ſending private meſſengers, they implored their aſſiſtance; and <hi>beſought them in compaſſiou of the poore ſilly people, who were almoſt waſted with a great mortality, to pacifie the anger of the conquerous, whom they had moſt juſtly incenſed:</hi> told them, <hi>all their hopes lay in them, and they were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undone without their help.</hi> Proteſted moreover, <hi>that if they found mercy but that one time, they would redeeme their former revolt with more religious fidelity and conſtant Allegiance ever after.</hi> The priſoners (whom but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day the baſeſt of the people bitterly abuſed and reviled, curſing and bequeathing them to the gallowes and worſe) for getting all injuries receiv'd, and more troubled with the ſenſe than revenge of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, firſt rendred hearty thanks to Almighty God who of his mercy ſhewed unto them that liberty and ſafety which they little expected; and then turning unto their deadly enemies, bad them <hi>be of good chear, for the moſt gracious King (and his Lieutenant</hi> Montroſe) <hi>deſired the ſafetp and happineſſe of his repenting Subjects, and not their extirpation and ruine. Therefore they adviſed them immediately to ſend ſome delegates, to</hi> Montroſe, <hi>humbly to beg his pardon; for nothing could better appeaſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116000:56"/> the rage of a Conquerour than a ſpeedy ſubmiſſion. For their parts they would not be backward to mediate with him for their ſafety, and doubted not but his high and noble ſpirit which could not be vanquiſhed with their armes, would yet ſuffer it ſelf to be overcome with the prayers and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men in miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Edinburgians</hi> being comforted with theſe hopes, and aſſiſted with this good advice, immediately call a Hall to conſult of ſending Delegates. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the priſoners of thoſe that were moſt high in birth, and favour with <hi>Montroſe, Lodowick</hi> Earl of
<hi>Crawford,</hi> Chief of the moſt antient and noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the
<hi>Lindſeys,</hi> a man famous for Military ſervice in forraign Nations, amongſt the <hi>Swedes, Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This man by the power and cunning of his coſen the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> (who becauſe he was greedy of the honour and title of the Earl of
<hi>Crawford,</hi> was greedy alſo of his life) was deſigned by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters to be put to death. Nor was it for any other crime but for being a Souldier, and an expert man, and one that had done faithfull ſervice for his Maſter the King, and it was feared he would doe ſo again if he ſhould be ſuffered to live. There was alſo <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> one ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved by
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> who was formidable both for his fathers and his own vertue and authority. He alſo being an enemy to <hi>Argyle,</hi> both upon old fewds and ſome freſher wrongs, was juſt as deep in ſin and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as
<hi>Crawford.</hi> Theſe therefore the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> choſe out of the reſt of the priſoners, and immediately ſetting them at liberty, they earneſtly pray and beſeech them to aſſiſt their Delegates to the uttermoſt of the power they had with the Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and to labour to hold his hands off that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable City, upon which the hand of God himſelf lay ſo heavy already. And they curſe themſelves and their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:116000:56"/> poſterity to the pit of hell, if they ſhould ever prove unmindfull of ſo great a favour, or unthankfull to them that did it. They were not backward to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a buſineſs which was ſo univerſally deſired, but taking the Delegates along with them went forth to
<hi>Napier.</hi> He having by the way delivered his dear father, his wife, his brother-in-Law Sir <hi>Sterling Keer,</hi> and his ſiſters out of the priſon at <hi>Limnuch,</hi> whither the Covenanters had removed them from
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle, marched back unto his Uncle with his Forces, and thoſe priſoners now at libety, and the Delegates of the City, as having done his buſineſſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <hi>Crawford,</hi> and
<hi>Ogleby,</hi> his deareſt friends, whom he had long longed for, and rejoycing to ſee them ſafe and ſound, uſed them with all honour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation after their long reſtraint, and they on the other ſide magnified their deliveter and avenger with high praiſes and thanks, (as became them to doe,) on both ſides affording a ſpectacle of great joy to the beholders.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Delegates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to audience, and delivered their Meſſage from the Provoſt and City. The ſum was, <hi>They would freely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the Town unto the Governour, humbly deſired his pardon, promiſed to be more dutifull and loyall for the time to come; committed themſelves and all that they had to his patronage and protection, for which they earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſongbt him. Moreover they undertook forthwith to ſet the reſt of the priſoners at liberty according to his appointment, and to doe any thing elſe that he ſhould enjoyn them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the City was ſo waſted with a grievous contagion that no men could be raiſed out of it, yet they were ready as far as their ſhare came, to pay contribution to ſuch as ſhould be raiſed in other places. And above all things they humbly begged at his hands, that he would labour to mitigate the anger of their moſt gracious Lord the King, that he might
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:116000:57"/> not be too ſevere with that City, which by the cunning, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and example of a ſeditions and prevailing party had been engaged in Rebellion.</hi> Montroſe bad them <hi>be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the reſt, and required no more at their hands than to be hereafter more obſervant of their loyalty to the King, and faithfully to renounce all correſpondence with the Rebells in armes against him, either without or within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; To restore the Caſtle of</hi> Edinburgh <hi>(which it was evident was in their cuſtody at that time) unto the King and his Officers. Laſtly, aſſoon as the Delegates came home, to ſet the priſoners at liberty and ſend them to him.</hi> And truly as for the priſoners they ſent them away upon their return: but as to other Articles they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, and perjured; and if they doe not repent muſt one day give an account unto God the aſſertor of truth and juſtice for their high ingratitude, and reiterated diſloyalty.</p>
               <p>Whiles theſe things paſſed concerning <hi>Edinburgh, Montroſe</hi> ſent away <hi>Alexander Mac-donel</hi> (to whom he joyned
<hi>Iohn Drummond</hi> of <hi>Ball,</hi> a ſtout Gentleman) into the Weſtern coaſts to allay the tumults there, and to ſpoil the deſignes of
<hi>Caſſils</hi> and <hi>Eglington.</hi> But they receiving the alarm of
<hi>Mac-donells</hi> approach, were immediately diſperſt in a great fright. Some of the Earls and other Nobles made ſtraight into <hi>Ireland,</hi> others plaid leaſt in ſight in I know not what lurking places. All the Weſtern Countries, the Towns of <hi>Aire, Irwin</hi> and others, ſtrove which ſhould firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, freely offering their fidelity and ſervice. Neither (which was more than he expected) did <hi>Montroſe</hi> ever find men better aſſected to the King than in thoſe Weſtern parts: For moſt of the Gentry, Knights, and Chiefs of Families, and ſome alſo of the prime Nobility came off chearfully to his ſide. Whoſe names, which otherwiſe ought to have been regiſtred with honour, at the preſent I ſhall paſſe by (if not in an
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116000:57"/> acceptable perhaps, yet certainly in an advantageous ſilence,) for I ſhould be loath ſo honeſt and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſouls ſhould be queſtioned by their cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for their good affections, upon my informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> had now taken into his thoughts the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the South-borders, and ſent unto the Earls of <hi>Hume, Rosburough,</hi> and <hi>Trequair,</hi> to invite them to aſſociate with him for matter of Peace and War, and all things that were to be done in the name and by the authority of the King. Theſe were not only the powerfulleſt men in thoſe parts by reaſon of the multitude of their friends and their great retinue, but alſo made as though they were moſt cordiall aſſertors of the Kings authority. For beſides the bond of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which was common to them with others, they were engaged unto him by extraordinary benefits. Nor were they only advanced unto great Honours by him, as being raiſed from the order of Knighthood to a high pitch of Nobility; but were made Governours of the moſt gainfull Countries, and by that means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enriched above their equalls and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, heaped up wealth indeed unto themſelves, but envy and hatred upon the King. They again diſpatch ſome of their friends of the beſt quality to aſſure him, <hi>That they were ready to undergoe any hazard under his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and command in the behalf of their moſt bountifull King, They promiſe moreover to raiſe a world of men, and nothing bindred their coming up unto the Camp, if he would but be pleaſed to draw that way with never ſo ſmall a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his forces. And ſo it would come to paſſe, that not only their friends and clients, but the whole Country being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:116000:58"/> with his preſence and authority, would cheerfully take up armes as oreman; and if they ſtood out, they might be compelled, or a courſe taken with them. Therefore they earneſtly beſought him to aſford them his aſſiſtance in this, and in all the reſt he ſhould find them his moſt faithfull and ready ſervants.</hi> Theſe were fair words, and at firſt heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeem'd to carry an honeſt meaning along with them; but were promiſed with that kind of faith that the Creatures and Favourites of the too indulgent King are uſed to keep. And perhaps upon that ſcore the Earl of <hi>Lancrick</hi> (Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> brother) is more to be commended, whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> having earneſtly follicited by friends to come off to the Kings ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that way he might very likely expect his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for what was paſt, and the releaſement of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet without any diſſimulation he gave this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory anſwer,
<hi>That he would have nothing to doe with that ſide, and that he would never pretend that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which he intended not to preſerve.</hi> And I would to God all they on whom the good King has too much relied, had delivered themſelves with the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and plain dealing ever ſince the beginning of theſe troubles.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſent the Marqueſſe of <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> over into
<hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Niddiſdale,</hi> that there with the aſſiſtance of the Earls of <hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Hartfield,</hi> they might liſt as many ſouldiers, Horſe eſpecially, as they could. And gives them orders withall to march with ſuch as they ſhould ſo raiſe towards <hi>Trequaire, Roxborough,</hi> and <hi>Hume;</hi> that they might engage them without any further put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offs in an aſſociation with them. For
<hi>Montroſe</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a little what Court-holy-water meant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſomething ſuſpitious of the delayes which they fram'd, the rather having, had ſome experience of their cunning and ſlipperineſſe, eſpecially of <hi>Trequaires.</hi> And truly <hi>Doughlaſſe</hi> by the chearfull endeavours
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116000:58"/> of the Earls of <hi>Anandale</hi> and
<hi>Hartfield,</hi> had quickly raiſed a conſiderable party, if one count them by the head; but they were new men, taken from their plowes and flocks, and but raw ſouldiers: forward enough at the firſt charge, but by and by their hearts fail them, and they can by no means be kept to their colours. When
<hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and the reſt of the Commanders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this, they write again and again to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> that he would make haſte after them with his old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers towards <hi>Tweed;</hi> for by his preſence and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the company and example of the old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they might be brought either willingly, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or no, to know their duties. In the mean time according to his command they goe on to
<hi>Strathgale,</hi> freely offering an opportunity, and their ſervice if it needed, to <hi>Roxborough</hi> and <hi>Trequaire</hi> to draw out their men the more eaſily &amp; timely. But they (good men) who well enough underſtood the ſecreteſt counſels of the Covenanters, and knew that all their Horſe would be there immediately out of <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>David Leſley,</hi> intended nothing more than to over-reach the King with their old tricks, and to deliver <hi>Montroſe</hi> (whoſe glory they envied) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of his enemies, though not by armes (for that they could not) yet by treachery. To that end they inſinuate again and again not only unto <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and his party, but to <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf by their friends and frequent meſſengers, that for their parts they were ready to expoſe their perſons to the utmoſt hazard, but they could never be able to draw together their friends, clients, and Trained bands, except they were animated and encouraged with <hi>Montroſe</hi> his preſence. And that they might be the better beleeved, they curſe themſelves to the pit of hell if they did not ſtand ſtifly and unalterably to their promiſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was not taken with all this, but ſtaid ſtill at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116000:59"/> 
                  <hi>Bothwel,</hi> conceiving that if there were any truth of honeſty in their words, <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and his party who ſtill ſay in the Country adjacent, would be ſufficient for the raiſing and encouraging of their friends and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>At length when <hi>Montroſe</hi> had quartered a great while at <hi>Bothwel,</hi> moſt of the Highlanders being loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſpoil ran priviſy away from their colours and returned home. Preſently after their very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders deſired Furloghs for a little while, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the enemy had not an Army in the field within the borders of that Kingdome, and therefore their ſervice for the preſent might well be ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Alſo they ſolemnly and voluntarily engaged their words, that they would return many more than they went, and much refreſhed, within forty dayes. Theſe <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſeeing he could not hold them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voluntiers and fighting without pay, that he might the more engage them, thought fit to diſmiſſe them not only with Licences but Commiſſions. And giving publick commendations to the ſouldiers, and thankes in his Majeſtics name to the Commanders, exhorting them to follow their buſineſſe cloſely and vigorouſly, he appoints <hi>Alexander Mac-donell</hi> their Countryman and Kinſman (who was but too ambitious of that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) to be their companion and guide, who ſhould bring them back to the Camp by the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Who in a ſet ſpeech gave thanks in all their names to the Lord Governour for his ſo noble favour; and as if he had been their Bail or ſurety, with a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:116000:59"/> ſolemn oath undertook for their ſudden return: yet he never ſaw <hi>Montroſe</hi> after. Not was he contented to carry away with him the whole Forces of the Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (who were more than three thouſand ſtout men) but he privily drew away ſixſcore of the beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<hi>Wales</hi> into <hi>Angleſey,</hi> and thence getting a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into
<hi>Loghaber,</hi> came into <hi>Athole,</hi> and was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the men of
<hi>Athole</hi> unto <hi>Montroſe.</hi> Almoſt all the Agents that came brought this Inſtruction amongſt the reſt, <hi>That it was his Majeſties pleaſure, that he ſhould joyn unto himſelf the Earls of</hi> Roxburough <hi>and</hi> Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair, <hi>and confide in their advice and endeavours; of whoſe ſidelity and induſtry no queſtion was to be made.</hi> Moreover <hi>that hee ſhould make haſte towards the</hi> Tweed,
<hi>where he ſhould meet a party of Horſe which the King would inſtantly diſpatch out of</hi> England <hi>to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, with whom he might ſafely give battell to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Leſly, <hi>if (as was ſuſpected) he marched that way with the Covenanters Horſe.</hi> All this the reſpective bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers unanimouſly delivered, and his moſt excellent Majeſty being over-credulous ſignified by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes. And <hi>Montroſe</hi> being now over-born with the Kings abſolute Commands, takes up his reſolution to march to the ſide of <hi>Tweed.</hi> But the day before he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116000:60"/> went, the ſouldiers being drawn up to a Rendezvouz, (before that <hi>Mac-donell</hi> and the Highlanders were gone) Sir
<hi>Robert Spotſwood</hi> making an humble obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, under the Kings Standard, delivered his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Commiſſion under the Great Seale unto
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> which he again gave unto <hi>Archibald Primroſe</hi> Clerk of the Supreme Councell to be read aloud. That being ended, in a ſhort but ſtately Oration, he commended the Valour and Loyalty of the Souldiers, and the great affection he bore them. And for <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donell,</hi> he not only extoll'd his gallantry in the head of the Army, but by vertue of that authority that he had received from the King gave him the honour of Knighthood. For not only <hi>Montroſe,</hi> but all the Kings friends were confident of the integrity of the man; whoſe good opinion he deceiv'd, not only to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of the Kings cauſe, but the utter ruine of himſelf and his friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> following his intended journey, came the ſecond night to <hi>Calder</hi> Caſtle; at which time the Earl of
<hi>Aboine</hi> (whether the Lord Governour would or no) carried away with him not only his own men, but all the reſt of the Northern Forces, whom he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighled to deſert the ſervice. Nor would he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded either by reaſon or the intreaty of his friends (who heartily deteſted that ſhamefull act) to ſtay but ſo much as one week, and then he might depart not only with the Generalls licenſe, but with honour, and the good eſteem of honeſt men. Seeing it would be no better, <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſing by <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> led his ſmall Army through <hi>Lothainſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Strathgale</hi> joyned with <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and the other Commanders, whoſe Forces being much diminiſhed, were daily mouldring more and more. In that coaſt <hi>Trequaire</hi> himſelf came unto him, more chearfull and merry than he uſed to be; who pretended himſelf to be a moſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116000:60"/> faithfull ſervant not only to his Majeſty, but alſo to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the next day ſent him his Son the Lord <hi>Linton</hi> with a gallant party of Horſe, as if they were to be under his command, that by ſo likely a pledge he might make
<hi>Montroſe</hi> more ſecure, and ſo more eaſily ruine him. For this was not the firſt time that <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire</hi> plaid the Covenanters Scout-Maſter: that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulleſt piece of mankind intending to betray unto them <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and in him the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now when he was not above twelve miles from the Lords
<hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Roxborough,</hi> and they ſent not ſo much as a Meſſenger to him, nor offered him the ſmalleſt courteſie,
<hi>Montroſe</hi> being much troubled at it, reſolved to march into their Territories, and to bring them in either by fair means or ſoul. But they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him by a ſingular device; They ſent unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Leſley</hi> whom they well knew by that time was come to <hi>Berwicke</hi> with all the Scotch Horſe, and many Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Voluntiers (for they were privy to all their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells) and entreated him to ſend a party and carry them away in the condition of priſoners; which he did the day before
<hi>Montroſe</hi> came thither. For by this means that craſty old fox
<hi>Roxborough</hi> (who had <hi>Hume</hi> under his girdle) conceiv'd that they might both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate themſelves with the Covenanters, as freely committing themſelves into their protection, and yet keep in the Kings favour, whiles they made as if they fell into <hi>Leſtey's</hi> hands ſore againſt their wills. And this being <hi>Leſley's</hi> firſt noble exploit, he paſſed over <hi>Tweed</hi> and marched into the Eaſtſide of
<hi>Lothian. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> aſſoon as he perceived the King and himſelf betray'd by theſe men, and ſaw no hopes of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Horſe which was come from the King, and that the too powerfull enemy would block up his paſſage into the North and Highlands, reſolved to march with thoſe few men he had into <hi>Niddiſdale</hi> and <hi>Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:116000:61"/> and the Countrey of <hi>Ayre,</hi> that he might there raiſe what Horſe he could. For although he had no certain intelligence concerning the ſtrength of the enemy, yet he conjectured that it conſiſted eſpecially in Horſe.</p>

For he was reſolved to make ſure of all advantages of ground, leſt he ſhould be forced to fight with an enemy of whoſe ſtrength he knew nothing upon uneven termes. Then he commands the Captains of Horſe to ſet out good ſtore of faithfull and active Scouts, and to place Horſe-guards in convenient places on every ſide, and look well to their watch. All which he in perſon (as he uſed to doe) could not ſee done at preſent, becauſe that night he was diſpatching letters to the King, and to ſend away a truſty meſſenger that he had light upon, before break of day: therefore he was earneſt with them to have the more care, leſt the enemy who were very ſtrong in Horſe ſhould ſurpriſe them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares. And the Commanders promiſing all care and diligence, he was ſo taken up with writing of Letters that he ſlept not all that night. And ſending ever and anon to the Captains of Guards (men that were skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Souldiers, and ſo known to be in forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) ſuch uncertain noiſes as were brought unto him of the enemies approach; they being dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Leſley</hi> contrary to that reſolution, gives order on a ſudden to his whole Forces to wheel to the left hand, and to march away apace; every one wondering that knew not the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the buſſineſſe, what ſhould be the meaning of that change of his reſolution, and his intention in that ſudden expedition, for they marched ſtreight to <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi> But the matter was, (as they afterward gathered from the enemies themſelves) he had received letters by which he had perfect notice that <hi>Montroſe</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only with five hundred Foot, and thoſe Iriſh, and a very weak party of new-rais'd Horſe, might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily be ſurpriſed on the borders of <hi>Tweed,</hi> if
<hi>Leſley</hi> would make uſe of that apportunity was offered him to doe his buſineſſe. Therefore <hi>Leſley</hi> upon this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence made haſte thither, and (as I ſaid) lodg'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four miles of
<hi>Selkirk.</hi> That <hi>Trequair</hi> ſent thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto

                  <hi>Linton</hi> that he ſhould immediately withdraw himſelf from the Royall party, which with much jollity he did. This was like themſelves, being the ungrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of all men, deſerting their King of whom none had better deſerved, and ſtaining their poſterity. And truly that morning being very miſty, gave no ſmall advantage to the treachery of the enemy; whom at laſt <hi>Montroſe's</hi> frighted Scouts diſcovered to march towards him in a full body, at ſuch time as they were not above halfe a mile off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> mounting the firſt horſe he could light on, gallops into the field appointed for the Rendezvouz that morning; where he finds a great deal of noiſe, but no order.

Yet there were a few, and thoſe were for the moſt part Noblemen or Knights, who made all ſpeed thither, and gallantly undertook to make good the right wing: and they were not above ſix ſcore in all. Nor did the foot (who were not above five hundred) make a good appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for many of them looking about their private buſineſſes among the Carriages, by that unſeaſonable care of ſaving, loſt themſelves and all they had. And which ſpoiled the matter, which was bad enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt of the Commanders were abſent and never came in the field. Beſides, the enemy coming on ſo ſpeedily, left them no time for deliberation. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy therefore, who were ſix thouſand (whereof moſt of them were horſe out of <hi>England)</hi> furiouſly charging <hi>Montroſe's</hi> Right Wing, were twice gallantly received and repulſed with no ſmall loſſe. Nor could
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116000:62"/> they make that noble Troop give any ground, or break thorough it, untill at laſt, laying along thoſe few foot thtat withſtood them, they broke in upon the left Flanck where there was no horſe. By this, two thouſand Horſe, whom the enemy had ſent over to the other ſide of the River, were gotten on the Rear of thoſe Noble Gentlemen, who, leſt being hem'd in on every ſide, and galled with the enemies ſhot at diſtance, they ſhould fall for nothing, and unreveng'd, withdrew themſelves every one the beſt way he could. But the Foot, who could have little ſecurity by flight, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good while ſtoutly and reſolutely, at laſt, upon Quarter askt and given for their lives, threw down their arms, and yeelded themſelves priſoners. Every one of whom being naked and unarm'd, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to quarter given, <hi>Leſley</hi> cauſed to be moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly butcher'd. The ſtain of which perfidious cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty (by which he hath ſo filthily blurr'd his Honour, if any he got in Forraign ſervice) he ſhall never be able to wipe away. As for thoſe that eſcaped out of the battell, the enemy purſued them no further, being buſie in plundering the Carriages, where they made a lamentable ſlaughter of Women, Pedees, aad Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys: no pitty was ſhown to Sex or Age, they went to the pot altogether. The number of the ſlain is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be given, almoſt no Horſe, and very few Foot (beſides thoſe that yeelded themſelves &amp; had quarter) fell in that Battell: which may appear by this, that they were no more then five hundred in all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next day two hundred and fifty of them came ſafe to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> all of them with their ſwords by their ſides, ſo that there could not be as many more miſſing: and very few were taken priſoners, and not untill their horſes being tired, and themſelves ignorant of the way, they became a prey to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people. Whom they, forgeting all the benefits
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116000:63"/> and protection they had but newly received from <hi>Montroſe,</hi> to do the Covenanters a favour, delivered up unto their cruell enemies, to be made by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifices unto
<hi>Baal-Berith,</hi> the God of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>For all that, the rebell conquerours miſſed of the Kings Standards, The one of them (which was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Foot) was preſerved by an Iriſh ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a ſtout man, and of a preſent ſpirit when others were almoſt beſide themſelves; who when he ſaw that the enemy had got the day, ſtript it off the ſtaffe and wrapped it about his body: and being otherwiſe naked, made his way with his drawn ſword through the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the enemie, and brought it to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> at night. Whom he received into his life-guard, and gave it him to cary intoken of his valour &amp; loyalty. And the other of them <hi>William Hie,</hi> brother to the Earle of <hi>Kinoule,</hi> a hopefull young Gentleman (who ſucceeded his uncle by the mothers ſide, <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> ſon to the Earle of
<hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who having received many and grievous wounds at the battell of <hi>Alford,</hi> was render'd unable for that burden) ſtript from of the ſtaff too, and carried it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him, and conveighing himſelf into the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>England,</hi> skulked there a while till the coaſt was a little clearer about <hi>Tweed,</hi> and then through by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and night-journies for the moſt part (being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied and conducted by his faithfull friend <hi>Robert Toures,</hi> a ſtout man, and a good ſouldier, who had bin a Captian in <hi>France</hi> a good while ago) returned into the North, and preſented that ſame Royall Standard unto the Generall.</p>
               <p>And now at laſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> when he ſaw his men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally routed and put to flight (which he never ſaw before) thought of nothing more for a good ſpace than to die honourably, and not unrevenged; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rallying about thirty Horſe whom he had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116000:63"/> up in that confuſion, he reſolved by fair and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable death, to prevent his falling alive into the enemies hands. And ſeeing he was not able to break through the enemies Troops (who ſtood thick round about him) he gall'd them on the Front, and Reare, and Flanks, and of ſuch as were ſo hardy as to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of their Ranks, many he ſlew, others he beat back.

                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> was gotten ſcarce three miles from

Notwithſtanding there are Gentlemen of credit that teſtify they were both within; nor did that gallant Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier only bid the Rebells joy of their victory, but was not aſhamed to tell abroad (not without profuſe and ill becoming laughter) that
<hi>Montroſe</hi> and the Kings Forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> were at laſt totally routed; his own daughter the Counteſſe of <hi>Queensborough,</hi> as far as modeſtly the might, blaming him for it. <hi>Montroſe</hi> after he had made a hault a while, neer a town called <hi>Peblis,</hi> untill the Souldiers had refreſht themſelves and were fit to march, many flocking to them from every ſide, at Sun-ſet they all ſtoutly entered the town: and by break of day next morning (by the conduct of Sir <hi>John Dalyel</hi> eſpecially) paſſed over <hi>Cluid</hi> at a Ford.

<hi>Airley,</hi> having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped an other way, met with him, making nothing of the loſs of Battell as ſoon as they ſaw him out of danger.

               <p>IT was towards the latter end of harveſt, nor was the corn reapt in that cold Country, nor their houſes and cottages, which the enemy had burnt, repaired againſt the approching winter (which is for the moſt part very ſharp thereabouts) which made the <hi>Athole</hi> men to abate ſomthing of their wonted forwardneſſe. Yet <hi>Montroſe</hi> prevailed ſo far with them that they furniſht him with foure hundred good Foot, to wait upon him into the North, where there was leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and faithfully promiſed upon his return, when he was to march South-ward, he ſhould command the power of the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Mean time frequent expreſſes came from <hi>Aboine</hi> that he would wait upon him immediatly with his Forces; and <hi>Mac-donnell</hi> promiſed no leſſe for himſelf and ſome other Highlanders.
<hi>Areskin</hi> ſignified alſo unto him that his men were in a readines, and waited for nothing but either <hi>Aboine's</hi> company, (who was not far off) or <hi>Montroſe's</hi> commands. About this time there were very hot but uncertain Reports of a ſtrong party of Horſe that were ſent him from the King, whom many conceived not to be far from the South-borders. But other newes they had which was too certain, to wit, that there was a moſt cruell butchery of what priſoners the Rebells had, without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sex or age: ſome falling into the hands of the Country people, were baſely murthered by them, others who eſcap't them (and found ſome pity in them that had ſo little) being gathered together, were by order from the rebell Lords thrown head-long from off a high Bridge, and the men together with their wives and ſucking children drown'd in the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; and if any chanced to ſwim towards the ſide,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116000:65"/> they were beaten off with pikes and ſtaves, and thruſt down again into the water. The Noblemen and Knights were kept up in naſty priſons to be expoſed to the ſcorn of the vulgar, and certainly doom'd at laſt to loſe their heads. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was never ſo much troubled as at this ſad news.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the end he might ſome way relieve his diſtreſſed friends, being impatient of all delay, with wonderfull ſpeed he climbs over <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> and paſſing through the plains of
<hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Strathdone,</hi> maketh unto the Lord of
<hi>Aboine,</hi> that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him by his preſence to make more haſt into the South. For his deſign was, aſſoon as he had joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his forces with <hi>Areskins</hi> and <hi>Airleys,</hi> and ſent for
<hi>Mac-donell</hi> and other Highlanders, and taken up the <hi>Athole-</hi>men by the way, to march in a great body ſtraight over the <hi>Forth;</hi> and ſo both to meet the Kings Horſe, and to fright the enemy, upon their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an imminent danger to themſelves, from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the priſoners to death. For he conceived they durſt not be ſo bold as to execute their malice upon men of Nobility and Eminency, as long as they had an enemy in the Field, and the victory was uncertain. And truly, they being doubtfull and ſolicitous what might be the ſucceſſe of ſo great warlike preparations as they knew were in providing, did deferre the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the priſoners. <hi>Montroſe</hi> upon his journey found the Lord
<hi>Areskin</hi> very ſick, but his clients (whoſe fidelity and valour he had had ſundry expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of, even in the abſence of their Lord) all in a readineſſe if <hi>Aboine</hi> did but doe his part; for they depended much upon his example and authority. And now the Marqueſle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> after he had plaid leaſt in ſight for a year and ſome months, (it is hard to ſay, whether awaken'd with the news of ſo many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories obtain'd by
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the reducing of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116000:66"/> Kingdome, or by the deceitfull influence of ſome bad ſtarre) was returned home. An unfortunate man and unadviſed, who howſoever he would ſeem moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate unto the Kings Cauſe (and perhaps was ſo) yet he endeavoured by a cloſe &amp; diſhonourable envy, rather to extenuate <hi>Montroſes</hi> glory than to our-vie it. Which ſeeing it was not for his credit openly to profeſſe even before his own men (who were ſufficient witneſſes of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s admirable vertues) leſt by that he ſhould diſcover ſome ſymptomes of a heart alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the King; yet he gave out, that for the time to come he would take upon himſelf the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that War againſt the Rebells; therefore he commanded his Tenants, and adviſed his friends and neighbours, ſcarce without threats, to ſight under no command but his own. And when they replyed, <hi>What ſhall we then anſwer to the Commands of the Marqueſſe of</hi> Montroſe <hi>whom the King hath declared Generall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Kingdom, and Generall of the Army?</hi> He made anſwer, <hi>That he himſelf would not be wanting to the Kings ſervice; but however it concerned much both his and their honour, that the King and all men ſhould know what aſſiſtance they had given him, which could not otherwiſe be done than by ſerving in a body by themſelves.</hi> Moreover, he fell to magnifie his own power, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s; to extoll unto the skies the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acts of his Anceſtors, (men indeed worthy of all honour,) to tell them, <hi>That the</hi> Gordons <hi>power had been formidable to their neighbours for many Ages by-gone, and was ſo yet; That it was moſt unjuſt that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements gotten with their bloud and proweſſe, ſhould be accounted upon another mans</hi> (meaning Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe's) <hi>ſcore: but for the future he would take a courſe, that neither the King ſhould be defrauded of the ſervice of the</hi> Gordons, <hi>nor the</hi> Gordons <hi>of their deſerved honour, favour, and reward.</hi>

Nor were there wanting amongſt them, deſperate men and of good fore-ſight, who condemned this counſell of his as unwiſe, unfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and pernicious unto himſelf. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderd with themſelves that <hi>he never had any deſign that did not miſcarry either by bad play, or bad luck. That bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſes were better carried by</hi> Montroſe, <hi>and it was ill to make a faction upon the poor pretence of his carrying away the honour of it. For if</hi> Huntley <hi>joyned his Forces, and communicated his Counſeils unto</hi> Montroſe, <hi>he ſhould not be only able to defend himſelf, but ſubdue his enemies, and gain unto himſelf the everlaſting honour of being one of the Kings Champions; but if he ſhould make a breach in that manner, it would proove not only diſhonourable but deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to him. That</hi> Montroſe <hi>(it could not be denied) bad got many and eminent victories with the aſſiſtance of the</hi> Huntleys, <hi>but they had done nothing of note without him.</hi> Therefore they earneſtly deſired him, <hi>conſtantly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto the Kings Lieutenant, which as it would be both acceptable and advantagious to the King, ſo it would be well taken with good men, and honourable to himſelf,</hi> Nor did ſome of them fear to profeſſe openly, that they would yield their duty and ſervice to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> if <hi>Huntley</hi> ſhould ſtand out in his humour; and they were as good as their words. But he refuſing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his friends, reſolved what ever came on't to run counter to <hi>Montroſe;</hi> nor did

               <p>For all this <hi>Aboine</hi> being at that time ſolicited by many expreſſEs from <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the importnity of his own friends (that he might be ſome way as good as his word) met him with a conſiderable party at <hi>Druminore,</hi> a Caſtle of the lord
<hi>Forbeſes.</hi> He brought with him fifteen hundred Foot and three hundred Horſe, all cherefull and ready to under go any hazard under the command of
<hi>Montroſe.</hi> And truly as ſoon as ever thy met, <hi>Aboine</hi> freely proteſted he would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoſe men that he had, whetherſoever the Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſhould lead him: but there were many more behind (which for his ſcantnes of time he had not got together) which his brother
<hi>Lewis</hi> would bring him. <hi>Montroſe</hi> extolling highly his fidelity and pains, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back again almoſt the ſame way he came; that taking up the Lord <hi>Areskins,</hi> and the <hi>Marre</hi> Forces by the way, and climbing over <hi>Grainsbane,</hi> he might fall down into <hi>Athole</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> not doubting within a fortnight to be able to paſs over the <hi>Forth</hi> with a great Army. The firſt daies journy <hi>Aboine</hi> and his men marched with a good will, but tho next night his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lewis</hi> (whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> had placed under the command of the Earle of <hi>Crawford)</hi> conveighed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe homewards with a ſtrong party of Horſe, making as if he meant to encounter ſome Troops of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and carried along with him as many Souldiers as he could get, upon pretence of a guard. <hi>Crawford</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning brought word that
<hi>Lewis</hi> was gon home, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116000:67"/> would be back again next day, for ſo he had made him believe though he intended nothing les than to come back, a youth lyable to cenſure for more feats than that. But when upon the third day they came to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> it was obſerved that <hi>Aboines</hi> men were ſlow to ſtand to their Colours, that they loytered in their march, that their ranks were thin and diſorder'd, and that they ran away by whole Companies almoſt every night: and at laſt their Commander <hi>Aboine</hi> himſelf was not aſhamd to deſire to be excuſed, and to have leave to depart. When all men wondred and deſired to know what might be the reaſon of that ſudden alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his reſolution, he pleaded <hi>his fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which he was obliged in no caſe to diſoby; and that his father had not ſent him ſuch directions without juſt occaſion, for the Enemies Forces lay in lower</hi> Marre, <hi>and would be preſently upon their backs, if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the protection of their own men: and that it was unexcuſable ſolly for him to carry his men another way, when his own Country was in ſo much danger.</hi> Montroſe replyed, <hi>That it was moſt certain that only a few Troops of Horſe kept within</hi> Aberdene,
<hi>that they had no Foot at all, and thoſe few Horſe nor durſt nor could do the Country any harm; and there was no doubt but upon the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Beſides that it would be much more to the Marqueſſe of</hi> Huntley's <hi>advantage, if the ſeat of war were removed into the enemies Country, than be kept up in his own: and upon that ſcore there was more need to make haſt into the South, that they might ſave the North from the burthen of the Armies.</hi> He added moreover, <hi>That he dayly expected aid out of</hi> England, <hi>which could by no means joyn with them, except they met them on the South ſide of the</hi> Forth. And at laſt with much reſentment he repreſented unto him,
<hi>the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priſoners (who were many of them</hi> Huntleys
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116000:68"/> 
                  <hi>own Kindred, Allies, and Friends) who would all be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly murthered except they timely prevented it.</hi> To all this, when <hi>Aboine</hi> had nothing to anſwer, he deſired his Father might be accquainted with the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and 'twas granted. Such were made choice of to treat with <hi>Huntley</hi> as were conceived to be higheſt in his favour, to wit, <hi>Donald</hi> Lord <hi>Reſe,</hi> in whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he had ſo journed, and <hi>Alexander Irwin</hi> the younger of
<hi>Drumme,</hi> who had but the other day married <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's</hi> daughter: and both of them were alſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>Montroſe</hi> for their newly recovered liberties. <hi>Reſe</hi> being aſham'd to receive the repulſe, had not the confidence to return; and <hi>Irwin</hi> (a noble young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and a ſtout, who ſtuck to <hi>Montroſe</hi> to the laſt) brought no anſwer but his Father-in-laws ambiguous letters of which no hold could be taken. Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to deliver what he conceived his Father-in-laws reſolution was; he profeſt ingenuouſly he knew not what to make of him, he could get no certain anſwer, but doubted he was obſtinate in his fond conceit. <hi>About</hi> firſt declaring how ſore againſt his will it was to part with <hi>Montroſe,</hi> urged how neceſſary it was for him to pleaſe his dear father, who was ſickly too: &amp; therefore more earneſtly deſired the Lord Governour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with him for a few daies till he could pacific his father; and made an abſolute promiſe, that within a fortnight he would follow him with much ſtronger Forces. And when he had often and freely engaged his Honour to do as he ſaid, he extorted, with much adoe, a Furlogh from <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſore againſt his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, to be abſent for the time aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboine</hi> being returned home, <hi>Montroſe</hi> marched over the Plains of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Scharchioch,</hi> and came down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Aboine</hi> having ſent him word he would be with him, with his men, before the day appointed. At the ſame time came unto him, by ſeverall waies, Captain <hi>Tho. Ogleby</hi> of

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> when he had waited for <hi>Aboine</hi> with his Forces out of the North now three weeks, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his march or in
<hi>Srath-Erne;</hi> and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the rebells began to grow more outragious towards the priſoners, being impatient of further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, croſſeth over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and came into <hi>Leven,</hi> and he encamped upon the land of Sir <hi>Jhon Buchanan,</hi> the Ringleader of the Covenanters in thoſe parts, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting by that meanes, lying ſo near
<hi>Glaſcow,</hi> he might fright the Rebells (who then kept a Convention of Eſtates there) from the murther of the Priſoners. To which end facing the City every day with his Horſe, he waſted the enemies Country without any reſiſtance; although at that time, for the guard of the Eſtates and City, they had three thouſand Horſe in their quarters, and he not full three hundred, and twelve hundred Foot. Notwithſtanding before his coming down into
<hi>Leven,</hi> the Covenanters aſſoon as they underſtood that
<hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Montroſe</hi> agreed not, and that <hi>Aboine</hi> and his men had deſerted him in upper <hi>Marre,</hi> as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to the enſuing Tragedy, had beheaded three ſtout and gallant Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The firſt was Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> one, of whom we have had often occaſion to make honourable mention; a valiant and expert man, deare unto <hi>Montroſe</hi> from a child, and faithfull unto him to his laſt breath. The chief of his crimes was, that he would not pollute his hands with a moſt abhominable murther. For being ſent from <hi>Montroſe</hi> with an expreſs to the King after the battle of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> he was taken priſoner by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and was condemned unto death, which he had not eſcaped, except for feare of death, he had harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116000:69"/> unto <hi>Argyle,</hi> (who moſt unworthily ſet a price upon <hi>Montroſes</hi> head, and promiſed great rewards, honours, and preferments to whomſoever ſhould bring it in) and had taken upon him to commit that treaſon which he abhorred with all his ſoul. By which ſhift having his life and liberty given him, he returned ſtraight to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and diſcovered all unto him, beſeeching him to be more carefull of himſelf, for not he only (who heartily deteſted ſo high a villany) but many more, had bin offered great matters, moſt of whom would uſe their beſt endeavours to diſpatch him.</p>
               <p>The next was <hi>Alexander Ogleby,</hi> of whom we alſo ſpake bfore, eldeſt ſon to Sir <hi>John Ogleby</hi> of
<hi>Innercha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> deſcended of an ancient family, and much renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scotiſh Chronicles. He was but yet a youth (ſcarce twenty) but valiant above his age, and of a preſent and daring ſpirit. Nor can I hear or ſo much as conjecture what they had to lay to his charge, but that new and unheard-of Treaſon, to wit, his bounden duty and loyalty to his King. But there was no help for't, but <hi>Argyle</hi> muſt needs ſacrifice that hopfull youth it had bin for nothing but his names-ſake, for he bare an implacable fewd to the <hi>Oglebyes.</hi> The third was if Sir <hi>Philip Nesbit,</hi> of an ancient family alſo, and Chief of it next his father; who had done honourable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Kings Army in <hi>England,</hi> and had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Regiment there. Nor can I diſcover any reaſon they had to put him to death neither, (beſides that which is uſed when they have nothing elſe to ſay, that mad charge of the new high Treaſon,) except it was that their guilty conſciences ſuggeſted unto them, that that courageous and vigilant man might take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſometime here-after to be even with them for the horrid injuries they had done his father and his family. However theſe men ſuffer'd a noble death with patience &amp; conſtancy, as became honeſt men &amp; good Chriſtians.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116000:70"/> And unto theſe there are two brave Iriſh Gentlemen that deſerve to be joyned, Collonel <hi>O-Chaen,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Laghlin,</hi> odious unto the Rebels only for this impardonable crime, that they had had many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of their courage and gallantry. Theſe Iriſh Gentlemen were murthered indeed at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but many more were doom'd to the like execution at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> had not
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s unexpected approach within a few miles of the City had ſo much influence that it repriev'd them till another time. The Lord Governour was very much perplexed with the news of theſe mens death, and it was a queſtion whether he was more vex'd at the cruelty of the Rebells, or the negligence if not treachery of his friends. For beſides <hi>Huntley,</hi> whoſe Forces he had ſo long in vain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to come with his ſon
<hi>Aboine, Mac-donell</hi> alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (of whom he entertained an exceeding good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) being often ſent unto, and invited alſo by the neerneſſe of the place, although the time appointed by himſelf was already paſt and gone, made no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his approach. Six weeks had now paſſed ſince <hi>Aboine</hi> had ingaged himſelf for the Northern Forces, and the Winter (than which our age never ſaw ſharper) was already deeply entred. Beſides the aids that the King had ſent under the Command of the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> were defeated: all which might eaſily have been ſalv'd, and the Kingdome reduced again, if thoſe great Profeſſors of loyalty had not plaid faſt and looſe in that good Cauſe. Therefore at laſt on the 20. of <hi>November, Montroſe</hi> departing from
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and paſſing over the Mountains of <hi>Taich,</hi> now covered with deep ſnow, through woods and loghes whoſe names I doe not at this time well remember, croſſing alſo through <hi>Strath-Erne</hi> and over the <hi>Tay,</hi> returned into <hi>Athole.</hi> There he met Captain
<hi>Ogleby,</hi> and Captain <hi>Nesbit,</hi> whom he had formerly ſent with
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116000:70"/> the Kings Inſtructions unto
<hi>Huntley.</hi> And they bring word the man was obſtinate and inflexible, who would believe nothing that they ſaid; and when they unfolded unto him the Kings Commands, anſwered ſcornfully, <hi>That he underſtood all the Kings buſineſſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they, or the Governour himſelf; and neither he, nor any of his children ſhould have any thing to doe with him.</hi> Moreover he ſharply and threatningly reproved his friends and clients, who had willingly aſſiſted <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe;</hi> and dealt worſe with them than with Rebels. Nevertheleſſe the Lord Governour thought beſt to take no notice of any of theſe things, but bear with them; and whiles he treats with the <hi>Athole</hi> men for the ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> of that Country, he ſends again unto <hi>Huntley</hi> by Sir <hi>John Dalyel,</hi> as a more fit mediator of friendſhip. Who was <hi>to inform him of the danger the King and Kingdome was in, and ſo of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſery that hung over his and all faithfull Subjects heads; and to make it appear unto him that it was no ones but his and his ſons fault, both that they had not brought in the ſupplyes into</hi> Scotland, <hi>which the King had ſent, and that the priſoners, who were gallant and faithfull men, had been ſo cruelly butchered; and that yet there were many more remained, that had neer relations to</hi> Huntley <hi>himſelf, and ſome alſo of the prime Nobility, whom the Rebells would cut off after the ſame faſhion, unleſſe they were now at last relieved.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>to pray and beſeech him, that at least hee would grant the Kings Governour the favour of a friendly conference, promiſing hee would give him abnndant ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Huntley,</hi> although he anſwered <hi>Dalyel</hi> in all things according to his wonted peeviſhneſſe, yet he was moſt of all averſe to a Conference; as fearing (ſeeing he ſhould have nothing to anſwer to his arguments and reaſons) the preſence, the confidence, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſo excellent a man. But <hi>Montroſe,</hi> aſſoon as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:116000:71"/> things were ſetled in <hi>Athole,</hi> that he might leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted that might poſſibly bring him to better thoughts; reſolved, diſſembling all injuries, and obliging him by all good offices, to ſurpriſe him, and be friends with him whether he would or no; and to treat with him concerning all things that concern'd his Majeſties ſervice. Therefore in the moneth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> he forced his way very hardly through rivers and brooks, that were frozen indeed, but not ſo hard as to bear mens waight, over the tops of hills and craggy rocks, in a deep ſnow: and paſſing through <hi>Angus,</hi> and over
<hi>Gransbaine,</hi> drew his Forces into the North: and almoſt before he was diſcover'd, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a few men into <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> where
<hi>Huntley</hi> then liv'd. But he being ſtruck with his unexpected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, upon the firſt newes he heard of him, leſt he ſhould be forced to a Conference againſt his will, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fled to <hi>Bogie,</hi> a Caſtle of his ſituate upon the mouth of the <hi>Spey;</hi> as if he intended to ferry over the river, and to wage warre againſt the Rebells in
<hi>Murray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now it comes into my mind briefly to enquire what might be the reaſon why <hi>Huntley</hi> bore ſuch a ſpleen againſt
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> who had never given him any diſtaſte, but had obliged him with courteſies many times undeſerved. Nor could I ever hear, nor ſo much as gheſſe at any other cauſe but a weak and impotent (emulation I cannot call it, but) envy of his ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing worth and honour. For I ſhould be loath to ſay that his mind was ever alienated from the King, but onely averſe unto <hi>Montroſe;</hi> with the unjuſt hatred of whom he was ſo poſſeſt, that he precipitated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into many unexcuſable miſtakes; inſomuch as he deſired rather all things were loſt, than that
<hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould have the honour of ſaving them. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already puffed up with an unbeſeeming conceit
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:116000:71"/> of himſelf, he was the more exceedingly enraged againſt him upon the remembrance of thoſe injuries and diſgraces he had heretofore thrown upon him; and that was the chief reaſon (as I take it) that he ſo often avoyded the ſight of him. For, beſides what we have occaſionally delivered, both the father and the ſons had put neither few nor ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll affronts upon the Kings Vicegerent; ſome few of which it will not be out of our way to relate.</p>
               <p>The great guns which we told you <hi>Montroſe</hi> had hid in the ground the laſt year, they digging them up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge, carried away in a kind of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and diſpoſed of them in their own Caſtles, as if they had been ſpoils taken from the enemy, and would not reſtore them upon demand. But thoſe <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> had got in the ſights at Saint <hi>Johns-town,</hi> and at <hi>Aberdene;</hi> in the former of which there was never a man preſent of that Family, and in the other
<hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> and his men fought on the enemies ſide. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they ſo converted unto their own uſe the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and Arms, and other neceſſaries of War, which were gained from the enemy, and only depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Caſtles as in ſafe and convenient ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, that they would never make any reſtitution of the leaſt part of them when they were deſired. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Abome</hi> upon his return home after the victory of
<hi>Kilſythe</hi> ſet at liberty the Earl of <hi>Keith,</hi> Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> and other men of quality of the enemies ſide who were within his cuſtody, without acquainting the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Kingdome; and his brother-in-law young <hi>Drumme</hi> (who by chance was preſent) earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his diſlike of it. Upon what termes he did it, it is uncertain, but this is evident, that (beſides the affront done to the Lord Governour, and the loſſe of <hi>Dunotter</hi> Caſtle, which was of great ſtrength and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:116000:72"/> concernment in that War, and other Military advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they got by it) the Rebells would never have had the boldneſs to fall ſo cruelly upon the Priſoners, if he had but kept them in ſafe cuſtody. Yet more, by his own private authority, he exacted Tributes, and Cuſtomes, and Taxes, (which the Governour himſelf had never done) upon pretence indeed of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, but in truth to far other uſes, and to the grievous prejudice of the Kings Cauſe. Laſt of all (which is moſt to be lamented) either at the intreaty of the enemy, or for ſmall ſums of money, they had enlarged the priſoners that had been taken in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer battells in the North, and committed to cuſtody in their Caſtles. Nor would they permit them to <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s diſpoſall, though being priſoners of Warre he had reſerved them for that only purpoſe, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing them to ſave the lives of gallant and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men.
<hi>Huntley</hi> being pricked in his conſcience about all theſe things, was alwayes as afraid of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s preſence as of a Peſt-houſe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montroſe</hi> for all that, paſſing by injuries, and laying aſide all other matters, beſtowed his whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in the promoting of the Kings ſervice. And to that end he was reſolved to intrude himſelf into his company though never ſo unwelcome, to inſinuate into his friendſhip upon any conditions, to yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in all things, and to deny nothing, ſo that hee might qualifie <hi>Huntley</hi>'s imbitter'd ſpirit. Therefore leaving his Forces in their quarters, he poſted early in the morning with a few Horſe unto <hi>Bogie,</hi> and by his undream'd-of aproach prevented <hi>Huntley</hi> of any opportunity of flying or hiding himſelf. Aſſoon as they met, <hi>Montroſe</hi> forgetting all that was paſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him in ſmooth and gentle language to aſſociate with him in the War for the ſafety of the King and Kingdome: and gave him ſo full ſatisfaction in all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116000:72"/> things, that as being at laſt overcome hee ſeem'd to give him his hand; And promiſed that not only all his men, but he himſelf would come in perſon in the head of them, and be with him with all poſſible ſpeed. Afterward they layd their heads together concerning the manner of managing the War, and agreed that <hi>Huntley</hi> wafting over the <hi>Spey,</hi> ſhould make his way on the right hand by the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Murrey,</hi> and <hi>Montroſe</hi> was to goe round about on the left hand through <hi>Strath-Spey,</hi> which was at that time of the year, a very tedious and difficult march; and ſo the deſigne was to beſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> (of whoſe worth I have had often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak) and <hi>John Drummond</hi> of
<hi>Ball</hi> the younger (a Gentleman of approved truſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, who had often done excellent ſervice) with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commiſſions unto the
<hi>Athole-</hi>men, that if any ſhould offer to ſtirre in thoſe parts, they ſhould neglect no opportunity to ſuppreſſe them. The
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole-</hi>men being encouraged by their authority and example, ſhewed themſelves very ready and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: And they wanted not long an occaſion to ſhew it, for the remainder of the <hi>Argylian</hi> party (either by reaſon of a generall ſcarcity of all things in their own Country, or being driven out of their Country for fear of <hi>Macdonnell,</hi> who was very ſtrong, and threatned their ruine) fell upon the <hi>Mac-Gregories</hi> and
<hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabies</hi> who ſided with <hi>Montroſe.</hi> And afterward joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto themſelves the <hi>Stuarts</hi> which inhabite
<hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>widdir,</hi> and the <hi>Meniſes,</hi> and other highlanders who ſtill followed <hi>Argyles</hi> fortune, were reported to make up ſome fifteen hundred men; and were ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Athole</hi> unleſſe timely oppoſed. And truly they had already fired an Iland in
<hi>Logh-Torchet</hi> after they had taken it by force, and pillaged it, and had beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Ample</hi> Caſtle which lyeth on the ſide of the river of that name. Which aſſoon as they had intelligence of, the
<hi>Athole-</hi>men, being only ſeven hundred in all, under the Command of the aforeſaid <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Drummond,</hi> thought beſt to oppoſe them before they brake in into their Country. They upon the alarm of the advance of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Ample</hi> and retreated toward <hi>Taich.</hi> The <hi>Athole-</hi>men purſued them hotly, and find them in battell-array not farre from <hi>Kalandar</hi> a Caſtle of <hi>Taich,</hi> For they had poſſeſſed a ford, and manned the bank on the other ſide (which was fortified with a ſteep hill) with a number of Muſquettiers. Which men the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116000:73"/> 
                  <hi>Athole</hi> men ſaw, and perceived that their Forces were not ſo ſtrong as was reported (for they had not above twelve hundred men) although they themſelves were ſcarce ſeven hundred ſtrong, yet being heartned by the gallantry and encouragement of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they were reſolved not to ſtay to receive the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies charge, but to charge them. Therefore they place a hundred good ſouldiers over againſt the enemy, as it were to make good the Ford on the other ſide, and the reſt marched away unto another Ford neer the Caſtle, that they might get over the river there. The <hi>Argylcans,</hi> when they perceived the
<hi>Athole-</hi>men ſo reſolute, retreat ſtrait towards
<hi>Sterling.</hi> Then firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of-all thoſe <hi>Athole-</hi>men that were left below at the Ford, poſſeſſe themſelves of the bank which the enemy had quit, after that they fall upon the Rear of the retreaters, cut off ſome, ſcatter others, drive others forward, and the reſt of the
<hi>Athole-</hi>men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard after, put them all to ſlight. Fourſcore of them were ſlain, the reſt eſcaped by flight: who fared the better, becauſe that ſame morning the <hi>Athole-</hi>men had had a foul and tedious march of ten miles long, and had no Horſe at all to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So they having come off with credit returned home.</p>
               <p>At that time the Rebells held their Convention of Eſtates at Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> which they polluted with the Innocent, and I fear crying bloud of men never ſufficiently to be commended. They had amongſt their priſoners ſome very eminent men, as appeared by the hatred the Rebells bare them, (for they ſcarce ſought the bloud of any but the beſt of men, but for others of whom they were not ſo much affraid, thy ſatisfied themſelves only with their Sequeſtration and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) amongſt whom were the Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Spotſwood, William Murray,</hi> a noble young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116000:74"/> and <hi>Andrew Guthery,</hi> a ſtout Gentleman, and an active, whom they determined to put to death in that City, to appeaſe the Ghoſte of the men of that Province with their bloud, of whom it is reported, above five thouſand had been ſlain in ſeverall battells. Now, becauſe they intended not to proceed againſt them by Law, but according to their own luſts, they have recourſe to their old ſhifts, and make Religion draw the curtain over their cruelty. To which purpoſe they ſet up their Prophets <hi>Kant</hi> and <hi>Blaire,</hi> and others that were poſſeſſed with the ſame ſpirit, who roar'd out of their pulpits bloudy Oracles before the people; <hi>That God required the bloud of thoſe men, nor could the ſins of the Nation be otherwiſe expiated, or the revenge of heaven diverted.</hi> And by this art eſpecially they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the hearts of the people (otherwiſe inclined to pity) to think upon them as accurſed things, and own'd and devoted to deſtruction; perſwading them that they ought to have no protection of humane Laws, nor any Advocate to plead for them whom God himſelf indited and accus'd. Nor did thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent interpreters and deciders of Gods ſecret will, make any ſcruple to ſentence the ſouls and bodies, and all of ſo great Delinquents unto hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And having by this means blinded the people, it was eaſie for them who were their accuſers and judges both, to condemn the innocent men who were deſtitute of all patronage and protection.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ogleby,</hi> who was not onely the moſt eminent of them for Nobil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which when he had obtain'd, whilſt his keepers in reverence to the honourable Ladies, withdrew out of his chamber, he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:116000:74"/> immediatly puts on his ſiſters gown which ſhe had put off, and was dreſſed in all her attire. She alſo put on his cap in which he uſed to lie ſick in bed, and lay down inſtead of her brother. At laſt many ſalutations and ſome tears paſſing on both ſides, at eight of the clock in the night, in the habite and likeneſs of his ſiſter hee deceived his keepers, who lighted him out with candles and torches. And immediately depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the City, he took horſe (which he had laid for him) with two of his followers, and before morning was got out of danger. But when the next day his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant keepers hand found out their miſtake, <hi>Argyle</hi> was ſo unable to contain his wrath and revenge, that he would needs have the noble Ladies (and the more noble for this their compaſſion and adventure) brought in queſtion for it. But he could not effect it, for by reaſon of the equity of their cauſe, they found much ſtronger friends than he could, of the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> and
<hi>Lindſey;</hi> by whoſe connivence it is conceived by many that all this Comedy was acted; but in a thing that is uncertain I ſhall determine nothing.</p>
               <p>This cleanly conveyance of <hi>Ogleby</hi> out of their hands vext the Rebells exceedingly, and made them almoſt wilde; whence it happened that they made a quick diſpatch of the reſt. And the firſt that ſuffered was Collonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> a man of excellent endowments both of body and mind. Who being neer unto his death, bitterly lamented with many tears that the carriage of his youth had been much otherwiſe than it ought to have been. And when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to die, they offered him an Inſtrument to ſigne, wherein he was to teſtifie his repentance, he ſubſcribed it without any more adoe; and withall call'd God, and his Angels, and the men there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to witneſſe, that if any thing was contained in that paper which was contrary to the King, his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:116000:75"/> Crown or authority, he utterly diſavowed it. Then being abſolved from the ſentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under which he lay for adultery long ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to the great grief of the beholders he laid down his neck upon the block. A man ſubject indeed to that fault, but famous for his valour and ſouldier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip both in forein Countries and at home.</p>
               <p>The next that was brought upon the Scaffold yet reeking with the bloud of Collonel <hi>Gordon,</hi> was a man worthy of everlaſting memory, Sir <hi>Robert Spotſwood,</hi> one rais'd by the favour of King
<hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> unto great honours, as his ſingular vertues did merit. King <hi>James</hi> made him a Knight, and a privy Counſellour: King <hi>Charles</hi> advanced him to be Lord Preſident of the Seſſion, and now but of late Principall Secretary of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> This excellent man (although his very enemies had nothing to lay to his charge through all his life) they found guilty of high Treaſon; which is yet the more to be lamented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he never bore arms againſt them; for his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency lay in the way of peace, not knowing what belong'd to drawing of a ſword. This was therefore the onely charge that they laid againſt him; That by the Kings command he brought his Letters Patents unto
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> whereby he was made Vice-roy of the Kingdome, and generall of the Army. Nevertheleſſe he proved at large that he had done nothing in that, but according to the cuſtome of their Anceſtors, and the Laws of the Land. And truly he ſeemed in his moſt elegant Defence to have given ſatisfaction to all men except his judges (whom the Rebells had pick'd out from amongſt his moſt malicious enemies that ſought his death) ſo that queſtionleſſe they would never have pronounc'd that dolefull ſentence, if they had but the leaſt tincture of juſtice or honeſty. But to ſpeak the truth, a more powerfull envy than his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:116000:75"/> Innocency was able to ſtruggle with, undid the good man; For the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> having been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Principall Secretary of the Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by his revolt unto the Rebells forced the moſt gracious and bountifull King to the whole family of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> to take that Office from ſo unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a man, and beſtow it on another: nor was there any one found more worthy than
<hi>Spotſwood</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to ſo high an honour. And hence happened that great weight of envy and revenge to be thrown upon him, which ſeeing he was not able to bear out, he was forced to fall under.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Spotſwood</hi> being about to die, abating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his wonted conſtancy and gravity, according to the cuſtome of the country, made a Speech unto the people. But that Sacrilegious thief
<hi>Blair,</hi> who ſtood by him upon the Scaffold againſt his will, fearing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence and undauntedneſſe of ſo gallant a man, leſt the myſteries of Rebellion ſhould be diſcovered (by one of his gravity and authority) unto the people, (who uſe moſt attentively to hear, and tenaciouſly to remember the words of dying men) procured the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of the City (who had been once a ſervant to <hi>Spotſwoods</hi> father) to ſtop his mouth. Which inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and more than ordinary diſcourteſie, he took no notice of; but letting his Speech unto the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he wholly beſtowed himſelf in devotions and prayers to Almighty God. Being interrupted again, and that very importunatly, by that buſie and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome fellow <hi>Blair,</hi> and asked, <hi>Whether he would not have him and the people to pray for the ſalvation of his ſoul?</hi> He made anſwer, <hi>That he deſired the Prayers of the people, but for his impious Prayers, which were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable unto God, he deſir'd not to trouble him.</hi> And added moreover, <hi>That of all the plagues with which the offended Majeſty of God hath ſcourged that Nation,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:116000:76"/> this was much the greateſt (greater then the Sword, or Fire, or Peſtilence) that for the ſins of the people, God hath ſent a lying ſpirit into the mouth of the Prophets.</hi> With which free and undeniable ſaying, <hi>Blaire</hi> finding himſelf galled, grew ſo extremely in paſſion, that he could not hold from ſcurrilous and contumelious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage againſt his father who had been long dead, and againſt himſelf who was now a dying; approving himſelf a fine Preacher of Chriſtian patience and Longanimity the while. But all theſe things
<hi>Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> having his mind fixed upon higher matters, paſſed by with ſilence and unmoved. At laſt being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, and ſhewing no alteration neither in his voyce nor countenance, when he laid down his neck to the fat all ſtroke, theſe were his laſt words, <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Jeſu, gather my ſoul unto thy Saints and Martyrs who have run before me in this race.</hi> And certainly ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Martyrdome may be undergone not only for the Confeſſion of our faith, but for any vertue by which holy men make their faith manifeſt; there is no doubt but he hath received that Crown.</p>

                              <hi>To come to the particulars of my Treaſonable demeanour, (as they eſteem it) the main one is, that I did bring down a Commiſſion of Lieutenancie from his Majeſtie, to the Lord Marqueſſe of Montroſe, with a Proclamation for indicting a Parliament by the Kings Authority, wherein the Lord Marqueſſe was the Commiſſioner. Not to excuſe my ſelf upon the neceſſitie layd upon me to obey his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in a buſineſſe of that nature, in regard of the Charge I had about him; I cannot ſo farre betray mine own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to keep up from you my judgement of the thing it ſelf; ſeeing it may both tend to the juſtifying of the Kings part, and your better information, for lack whereof I know many are intangled in this Rebellion unwittingly; and who knoweth but God in his mercifull providence hath brought us hither to be the inſtruments of freeing you from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold deluſions that are made uſe of to inſnare you.</hi>

                              <hi>I ſay then it was juſt and neceſſary to his Majeſtie to grant ſuch Commiſſions, and by conſequence an act of duty in me to perform what he was pleaſed to command me.</hi>

                              <hi>It is known well enough what contentment his Majeſtie gave to the Kingdome at his laſt being here, both in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of Church and Policie; Notwithſtanding whereof the world ſeeth what meating he hath got from us. When this Rebellion firſt burſt out in</hi> England,
<hi>all that he deſired of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:116000:77"/> us was only to ſtand Neutralls, and not to meddle between him and his Subjects there. Of which moderate deſire of his little reckoning was made: but on the contrary at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of thoſe Rebells, by the power of their Faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, an Armie was raiſed and ſent into</hi> England, <hi>to aſſiſt them againſt their own native Ring.</hi>

Herewithall his Majeſties pitying the miſeries of this poor Kingdome (occaſioned by the rebellious ſtubbornneſſe of a few factious ſpirits) thought fit to give power to the ſayd Lord Marqueſſe, to call a Parliament in his own Name, to trie if by that means a remedie might be found againſt the preſent evills.</hi>

                              <hi>It cannot be but a great judgement upon a Land, when Gods ſingular mercies towards it are ſo little valued; hee hath not given us a King in his wrath, but one who for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bounty, and all vertues both Chriſtian and Morall may be a Pattern to all Princes, but how little thankfull we are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116000:78"/> to God for ſo great a bleſſing, our reſpecte towards him doe manifest.

               <p>And this was the end (a dolefull end indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of us, but a joyfull and honourable one in him;) of a man admirable for his knowledge of things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane; for his skill in the tongues, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Chaldee, Syriack, Arabick,</hi> beſides the Weſtern Languages; for his knowledge in Hiſtory, Law, and Politiques; the Honour and ornament of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and our Age for the integrity of his life, for his Fidelity, for his Iuſtice, for his Conſtancy; a man of an even temper and ever agreeing with himſelf; whoſe Youth had no need to be aſhamed of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, nor his tiper years of his Youth; a ſevere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the old-faſhion'd piety with all his ſoul, and yet one that was no vain and ſuperſtitious Profeſſour of it before others; a man eaſie to be made a friend, and very hard to be made an enemy; and who being now dead, was exceedingly lamented even by many Covenanters. His breathleſſe body <hi>Hugh Scrimiger</hi> once his fathers ſervant, took care to bring forth, as the times would permit, with a private funerall.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116000:78"/> Nor was he long able to bear ſo great a ſorrow and loſſe, for after a few dayes eſpying that bloudy Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold not yet removed out of the place, immediately he fell into a ſwoon, and being carried home by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and neighbours, died at his very dore.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they give unto <hi>Spotſwood</hi> another compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in death, <hi>Andrew Gutherey,</hi> ſon unto the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Biſhop of <hi>Murray,</hi> and hated the more by the Rebells for that. A youth, as well valiant in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, as conſtant in ſuffering and contemning death. He alſo was threatned and rail'd at by the ſame <hi>Blaire,</hi> but anſwered, That <hi>no greater honour could have been done him, than to be put to an honeſt death in the behalf of ſo good a King, and ſo juſt a Cauſe; which thoſe that were preſent ſhould ſee he embraced without fear, and perhaps another generation would not report without praiſe. For his ſins he humbly begged mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the hands of his moſt gracious Lord God; but for that which he ſtood there condemned, he was not much troubled.</hi> After this manner died with conſtancy and courage a man who if Almighty God had ſo thought ſit had been worthy of a longer life.</p>
               <p>And that now they might put the laſt Scene to a Tragedy of which moſt part was acted, after two dayes breathing they brought forth
<hi>William Murray,</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> a young Gentleman, to the ſame place. And truly every man much admired, that his brother being in great favour and eſteem amongſt the Covenanters, had not interceded for the life and ſafety of his own onely brother. Some impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to his ſloth, others to his covetouſneſſe, as ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after his brothers eſtate, others to his ſtupid and ſuperſtitious zeal to the Cauſe; but even all, the very Covenanters themſelves, condemned his ſilence in ſuch a caſe as diſhonourable, and miſ-becomming a Noble ſpirit. But the Youth himſelf, being not above
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:116000:79"/> nineteen years old, purchaſed unto himſelf everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renown with poſterity for ſo honeſt and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an end. Amongſt thoſe few things which he ſpake to the people, thoſe that heard him told me theſe words, which he ſpake with a higher voyce than the reſt; <hi>Account</hi> (O my Country-men) <hi>that a new and high addition of honour is this day atchieved to the houſe of</hi> Tullibardin <hi>and the whole Nation of the</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays, <hi>that a young man deſcended of that ancient ſtock, willingly and chearfully delivered up his innocent ſoul (as unto men) in the very flower of his youth, for his King, the Father of his Country, and the moſt munificent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of our Family. Nor let my moſt honoured mother, my dear ſiſters, my kindred, or any of my friends be ſorry for the ſhortneſſe of my life, which is abundantly recompenced with the honour ableneſſe of my death.

               <p>THe death of his friends troubled <hi>Montroſe</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as it had reaſon; but yet it was not able to break or ſhake his firm and ſetled reſolution. Not did his noble and more than ordinarily elevated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ever give greater evidences of it ſelf than now. For there were many who being emaged with the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy murder of their friends, egg'd him on, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſufficiently diſcontented, to a preſent revenge. And whiles they too much favoured their grief (although it was juſt) and ſeem'd to deſire nothing but what was fit, to wit, to render them like for like, they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out the Generall with their many, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and unſeaſonable complaints. For they muſt needs be angry, that their companions, their friends,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:116000:79"/> their kindred, noble and gallant Gentlemen, well deſerving of their King, their Country, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall himſelf, ſhould be murther'd contrary to their faith promiſed them, the cuſtome of Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Whom he entertained with a courteous Speech, commended them for the love they bare their friends, and told them, <hi>That the bloud of thoſe honourable and innocent Subjects ought to be reveng'd indeed, by ſuch a way as became honeſt and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men; not by baſeneſſe and miſchief as the Rebells doe, but by true valour, in a ſouldier-like way. It concerned them ſo to tame, as not to imitate the wickedneſſe of their enemies. Nor, if they conſidered matters well, was it cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that thoſe that were priſoners with them, and ſo could not be acceſſary unto the murther of their friends, ſhould ſuffer for thoſe ſins of which they were innocent. The faith that they had paſſed unto them was a moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thing, and to be kept inviolate even by enemies. Why ſhould they make themſelves guilty of that which they ſo much abhorred in their enemies?

               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:116000:80"/> Now <hi>Huntley,</hi> who intended nothing leſſe than what he promiſed <hi>Montroſe</hi> before his face, having paſſed over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and entred into <hi>Murray,</hi> trifled away his time, and waſted his ſtrength without either honour or profit, a good way off <hi>Innerneſſe.</hi> For giving his mind too much to prey and ſpoil, after he had waſted the Countrey, he heard a flying report, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants had hid their gold and ſilver, and the beſt of their ſtuff in certain turrets and obſcure Caſtles. Which whiles he aſſaults in vain, and could neither by commands, nor intreaties be taken off from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the enemy ſending in proviſion on that ſide which he had undertaken to block up, relieved <hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> with all things that they wanted. Which if he had hindered, as he undertook unto
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> the Garriſon would have been ſhortly forced to yeeld. And <hi>Montroſe</hi> having now received intelligence that Major Generall
<hi>Middleton</hi> was come with ſix hundred Horſe, and eight hundred Foot as farre as <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and was like to lay waſte <hi>Huntley</hi>'s and the <hi>Gordons</hi> Countrey, ſent Collonel <hi>William Stuart</hi> unto
<hi>Huntley,</hi> to entreat him to return again unto the ſiege of
<hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> according to his Engagement: Or if he did not approve ſo well of that, becauſe the enemy was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſo neer his Territories, he ſhould perſwade him to joyn his Forces with his, and to march imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly towards the enemy, whom he doubted not with an eaſie hazard to overthrow. To which he anſwered ſcornfully, that he would look to his own buſineſſe himſelf, nor did he need the help and aſſiſtance of
<hi>Montroſe</hi> to drive, the enemy out of his borders. At laſt after ten weeks ſpent in the ſiege of a ſmall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Caſtle, and the loſſe of all the forwardeſt of his men, he was forced with diſhonour to raiſe the ſiege, when he was never the neerer. And in contempt not ſo much of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> as of the Kings Majeſty, he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:116000:80"/> retreated to the <hi>Spey,</hi> without the conſent or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Vice-roy: giving thereby a very bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all men, who began to come in thick and three-fold with great eagerneſſe unto the Kings partie.</p>
               <p>Amongſt whom the chiefeſt for wealth and power, and multitudes of followers and dependant were the Earl of <hi>Seaford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Reſe,</hi> and from the furtheſt Ilands, Sir <hi>John Mac-donell,</hi> Chief of a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ancient family in the Highlands; <hi>Macklen</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and <hi>Glengar</hi> the Captain of the
<hi>Mac-Renalds,</hi> (and many more) who were ſome of them already in
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s Army with their Forces, others had ſent for theirs. And by this means before the end of <hi>March, Montroſe</hi> might have fallen down into the Low-lands with a farre greater Army than ever the Scots pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the memory of man. But the unexpected revolt of ſo great a perſonage did not leſſe encourage the Rebells to perſevere in their courſe, than ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and diſcourage honeſt and loyall hearts. Whence it happened that thoſe whoſe men were already come up to the Army began to draw off, and ſteal away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly, and others to make excuſes for their delay. All which put together made <hi>Montroſe</hi> to caſt about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. For he reſolved (ſeeing he could doe no good with van, light, wavering and inconſtant men by gentleneſſe and good Offices) to reduce them to his obedience by his authority, backed with the ſtrength of arms, and ſevere penalties; and to that end to force all the Highlanders and North-country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to take up arms, by marching in amongſt them with a conſiding party of good ſouldiers. For he well knew that many Governours and leading men in their reſpective Countries, and Chiefs of Septs were of his ſide, unto whom this courſe would be very acceptable. Nor did he queſtion but the chief and moſt powerfull
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:116000:81"/> of the <hi>Gordons</hi> being weary of their Lords miſcarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, would doe him the beſt ſervice they could if need was, though it ran counter unto <hi>Huntleys</hi> deſigne. However he was reſolved to uſe all fair means, if that would do, before he would put them to the coſt of that laſt and ſharpeſt remedy.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> was the moſt conſiderable garriſon of all the North, and the haven there moſt commodious for intertaining forein Forces, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more than to reduce that: therefore hee ſurrounded it with the Forces he had. For the enemies Army under the Command of <hi>Middleton</hi> was above fourſcore miles off, and <hi>Huntley</hi> and the <hi>Gordons</hi> lay half way between them in a body. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> dealt again with <hi>Huntley</hi> to perſwade him not to loſe his time, but (as they had agreed) to joyn with him in the ſiege of <hi>Innerneſſe;</hi> or at leaſt to hover about the
<hi>Spey,</hi> over which the enemy was to paſſe, and to hinder their paſſage if they advanced to raiſe the ſiege; and if they chanced to get over to joyn their Forces together and fight them. To all which he anſwered ſo diſdainfully, that the Vice-roy thought it high time to deſpair of any good from him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf engaged to look better to himſelf, leſt at laſt he ſhould betray him. So that putting no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in
<hi>Huntley,</hi> he ſent back three Troops of Horſe to lie at the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi> to obſerve the motion of the enemy, and if they came, to ſend him often and certain intelligence. And they, quartering themſelves in the moſt advantagious places for ſcouting, were carefull enough to obſerve his command; untill <hi>Lewis Gordon, Huntleys</hi> ſon, who then commanded the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> plaid a more ſhamefull prank than any he ever did before. Hee aſſured thoſe Captains of Horſe whom
<hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſet to guard the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi> that the enemy lay very far off, and intended
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:116000:81"/> nothing leſſe than to paſſe that river and raiſe the ſiege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and therefore he perſwaded them (who took him for a moſt faithfull friend) to let alone their needleſſe guards (to which they had been appointed) and to come to his Caſtle to refreſh themſelves, and with many complements invited them to a feaſt which he had provided for them: and they had no more wit than to truſt him, and go. He entertained them with a huge deal of courteſie, and beſides very dainty chear, plyed them with good ſtore of wine and ſtrong waters. And with a great deal of jollity, and ceremonious courteſie, detain'd them ſo long till <hi>Middleton</hi> with a great Army of Horſe and Foot had got over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and had gotten footing in <hi>Murray.</hi> Which aſſoon as he had notice of, he at length diſmiſt them, and that with theſe jeering termes; <hi>Goe now to your Generall</hi> Montroſe, <hi>who will have a ſharper bout now than he had at</hi> Selkirk. Mean time the enemy march'd ſtraight and eagerly towards
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> and thoſe Horſe getting paſt them with much ado, came not much before them to <hi>Innerneſſe,</hi> inſomuch as they ſeem'd to be but the Van of the enemie, and <hi>Middletons</hi> whole Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed within Cannot-ſhot. But, as the providence of God would have it,
<hi>Montroſe</hi> had notice of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach another way, and having drawn off his Forces a little way from the Town, had got them all into a Body. And when he perceiv'd the enemy to be much too ſtrong for him in Horſe, avoiding the plain, he retreated with his men beyond the <hi>Neſſe.</hi> The enemy falling upon the Rear, and being handſomly repuls'd, kept themſelves alſo cloſe. The loſſe on both ſides was very little, and almoſt equall. <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſed by <hi>Bawly</hi> into
<hi>Roſſe,</hi> whither the enemy purſued him, that taking him in the champain ground which was diſadvantageous to him, they might compell him to fight whether he would or no. But beſides that the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116000:82"/> enemy was much ſtronger than he, the Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being faithleſſe and rotten, and <hi>Seafords</hi> new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men running away by companies from their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, moved him with all the ſpeed he could to ſave himſelf from the enemies Horſe. Therefore paſſing by <hi>Logh-Neſſe,</hi> and through <hi>Strath-Glaſſe,</hi> and <hi>Harrage,</hi> he advanced unto the bank of the <hi>Spey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> was reſolved to proceed againſt
<hi>Huntley</hi> as a publick enemy, unleſſe he repented, but would try all fair means firſt, to ſee whether it was poſſible to bring him into a better mind. To which end, taking with him only one Troop of Horſe for his life-guard, in all ſpeed he rid twenty miles unto him to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle at
<hi>Bogy.</hi> And as he was on his way, he ſent one before to give him notice of his approach; and to tell him that he came thither alone and without his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to no other end than to kiſſe his hand, and to be adviſed by him concerning ſuch things as concerned the Kings ſervice; and he was the more earneſt to ſpeak with him, becauſe he had newly received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the King from <hi>Oxford,</hi> which he would let him ſee. But
<hi>Huntley</hi> being affrighted with the firſt news of
<hi>Montroſe</hi>'s approach, was ſo averſe from the preſence of ſo gallant a man, that in a trice he leapt on horſe-back, and with one man along with him ran away, any way he car'd not whither; nor vouch ſafed the Kings Vice-roy the favour of a conference or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Which aſſoon as
<hi>Montroſe</hi> underſtood, he returned back thoſe twenty miles the ſame day, being the 27 of <hi>May,</hi> and was as carefull as he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to conceal this frowardneſſe and unrulineſſe of
<hi>Huntleys,</hi> leſt it ſhould be a bad preſident. But all would not do, for the <hi>Gordons</hi> themſelves, and others of <hi>Huntleys</hi> friends, being moſt of them very honeſt men, and complete Gentlemen, told all with a great deal of indignation, and deteſtation of <hi>Huntley;</hi> that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:116000:82"/> by that means they might acquit themſelves from the aſperſion of ſo unworthy an act.</p>
               <p>Nor can one eaſily ſay how great influence that mans example had upon other Northern men: The Earl of <hi>Scaford,</hi> who had been but lately, and with much adoe reconciled to the Kings ſide, was conceived to begin to falter, and ſome ſay that being ſtill unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he had then underhand dealings for the making of his peace with the Covenanters, which truly I can hardly believe. And <hi>Alexander Mac-donell</hi> himſelf, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending I know not what, although he had had often and ſerious invitations, made nothing but ſleeveleſſe excuſes and put-offs from day to day. Which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his gave occaſion of ſtrange reports of him, as if he, although he was a bitter enemy to <hi>Argyle,</hi> yet had great correſpondence with, and relations unto the <hi>Hamiltons;</hi> and therefore ſlaid at home, and looked only upon the preſervation of the
<hi>Mac-donells,</hi> not medling with publique affairs. Which when
<hi>Montroſe</hi> conſidered, he reſolved without further delay to make his progreſſe over all the North-country and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands with a conſiderable party, to liſt ſouldiers, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the well-diſpoſed, to reduce thoſe that were refractory by the ſeverity of the Lawes and condign puniſhment, and to deal with them as men uſe to doe with ſick children, make them to take phyſick whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no. And he wanted not fitting inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to promote this deſign, who had earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with him to take that courſe.</p>
               <p>While theſe things paſſed at <hi>Innerneſſe, Huntley,</hi> leſt he ſhould be thought never to have done any thing by his own conduct without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> beſieged and took in <hi>Aberdene,</hi> (which <hi>Middleton</hi> kept with five hundred men) but with more loſſe to <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> himſelf than to the enemy. For, beſides the loſſe of many valiant ſouldiers, he gave his Highlander
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:116000:83"/> leave to pillage the City. But what fault thoſe poor innocent <hi>Aberdene-</hi>men had made either againſt the King or <hi>Huntley,</hi> let them judge, who know that almoſt all of them were eminent and obſerved for their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie. But for the enemy whom he took in Arms, who were both many, and of very good account amongſt their own party, he diſmiſt them freely without any conditions, and look'd fawningly upon them, rather like a Petitioner than a Conquerour. Nor when he had many Collonels, Knights, and others of qualitie (who by chance were found in
<hi>Aberdene)</hi> in his hands, did he ſo much as think of exchanging any one of his own friends for them, many of whom were priſoners either in
<hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> But this was his humour, being alwayes more ready to doe good for his enemies than his friends.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> being buſie about his deſign, on the laſt of <hi>May</hi> there came unto him a Herald with Commands from the King, (who by I know not what misfortune had caſt himſelf upon the Scotch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters Army at <hi>Newcastle)</hi> whereby he was required forthwith to lay down his arms and disband, and to depart into <hi>France,</hi> and there to wait his Majeſties further pleaſure. He being aſtoniſhed with this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected meſſage, bitterly bewailed the ſad condition of the King, that had forced him to caſt himſelf upon the mercy of his deadly enemies. And doubted not but that that command which was given him for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding was extorted from him by the craft, or force, or threats of the Rebells into whoſe hands he had fallen. But what ſhould he do in that caſe? If he
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:116000:83"/> obeyed, he muſt give over the eſtates of his friends to plunder, and their lives to death; and if he ſtood in arms againſt the Kings command, he ſhould be guilty of that crime he undertook to ſcourge in others, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. And eſpecially he was afraid leſt the Rebels ſhould put his actions upon the Kings account, and uſe him the worſe for them, ſeeing they had him in their power: of which the King had given him a fair hint in his Letter.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> reſolved to call together all the Noblemen, and Chiefs of Septs, and Knights, and others of quality that were of his ſide; that a matter of that conſequence which concern'd them all might be diſcuſt by generall conſent. To which end, after he had received ſo many injuries from him, he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Sir <hi>John Hurrey,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Innes,</hi> being men of greateſt account in his Army, and (as he conceived) moſt in <hi>Huntleys</hi> favour, unto him, to deſire him to be preſent at that ſo ſerious Conſultation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd unto him the appointment of the time and place. And to tell him moreover, that
<hi>Montroſe was willing to come to his Caſtle if he thought fit.</hi> Huntley anſwer'd, <hi>That the King had ſent him Letters alſo to the ſame effect, which he was reſolved to obey, that the Kings commands were of that nature as not to admit of ſecond thoughts, and after them nothing was left for conſultation.</hi> When they replyed, that <hi>that likely was</hi> Montroſes <hi>opinion too, and that he was as ready as any other to give obedience to the Kings Commands, if they were not forced; however it concer'd them all to provide in time for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them and theirs.</hi> And that
<hi>the credit and authority of what they reſolved upon would be greater, even in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the enemies themſelves, if they made a joynt and unanimous reſolution.</hi> He made no other anſwer than that <hi>he had reſolved for himſelf, and would have nothing to doe with any body elſe.</hi>

And, if he was fully determin'd to have that Army disbanded which fought for him (whiles the enemy in both Kingdomes were in a military poſture, and crow'd over them more and more) what courſe ſhould be taken for the ſecurity of the lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of his moſt gallant and faithfull Subjects, who had ſpent their bloud and all that was dear unto them for his ſake? For it was a lamentable caſe if ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men ſhould be left to the mercy of them that had none, not only to be undone, but to be murthered. To this he received no open anſwer, beſides ſome Articles which the meſſenger brought which were ſigned by the Rebells, with which <hi>Montroſe</hi> was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But he in great anger rejected thoſe conditions which the enemy had made, being ſo unconſcionable as they were; and not vouchſafing ſo much as to treat with the enemy, ſent back the bearer to the King, profeſſing that as he had not taken up arms but by the Kings Commiſſion, ſo he would have no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſcribed him to lay them down by any mortall man but the King himſelf. Therefore he humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the King, (if he thought it fit that he ſhould disband his Army) that he would not think much to make and ſigne the conditions himſelf; to which, though they prov'd perhaps very harſh, he promiſed abſolutely to ſubmit, but he ſcorn'd the Commands of any one elſe whoſoever they were.</p>
               <p>The meſſenger returning, at laſt brought with him Articles ſigned with the Kings hand, with injunctions now the third time, wherein he was required to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band without further delay; and the ſame meſſenger
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:116000:84"/> charged him in the Kings name, under pain of high Treaſon, to give obedience forthwith unto the Kings Command. And beſides his Majeſties pleaſure, there was another thing which haſtened him, which was that thoſe that had ingaged with him had moſt of them privatly and by their friends laboured to make their peace with the Rebells, which was evidently known by good tokens of the Earl of <hi>Seaford</hi> and others. As for <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Aboine</hi> they did not only profeſſe themſelves open enemies to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> but alſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall upon him by force of Armes, if he did not immediatly ſubmit to the Kings authority. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi> being newly arived out of
<hi>Ireland</hi> in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands without either men or Armes, buſied himſelf to draw away all the Highlanders, as his Kinred and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to himſelf from <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Army, whom in ſcorn he call'd the
<hi>Governour of the Low lands,</hi> making by this means an unſeaſonable fraction, and a pernitious one to his friends in thoſe parts. All which
<hi>Montroſe</hi> having well conſidered, he was forced according to the Kings Command to disband his Army.</p>
               <p>And truly that was a moſt ſad day, in which having ſolemnly prais'd and encourag'd his ſouldiers (as well as the occaſion permitted) he took his leave of them. For although he bid them be of good comfort howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and told them he ſaw ſome day-light of a bleſſed Peace, and that he did as much ſervice to the King by his preſent ſubmiſſion, as he had done before by his Martiall Atchievements. Yet notwithſtanding they all conceived that that was the laſt day of the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all of them believed for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that thoſe Commands from the King, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from him uppon the apprehenſion of greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to his Perſon if he had not given them. And all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome proviſions had been made by Articles in writing for their indempnity, yet they had rather have
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:116000:85"/> undergon the worſt that could fall, than ſurvive as idle and unſerviceable Spectators of the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their deareſt King. And it was no little vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to thoſe generous ſpirits, to think what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy opinion, Forraign Nations and their own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity muſt needs have of them, as if all the Scotiſh Nation had bin unanimouſly guilty of Rebellion and deſercion of ſo good a King. Beſides, their ſorrow was much augmented with the conſideration that their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who was moſt valiant, moſt ſucceſſefull, and therefore moſt beloved, ſhould be taken off ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily from the King, from his Country, from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all good men. So that his Souldiers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down at his feet, intreated him with tears in their eyes, that ſeeing the ſafety of the Kings perſon depended ſo much upon it, and he muſt of neceſſity depart the Kingdome, he would be pleaſed to take them along with him into what part of the World ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went. Profeſſing their readines to live and fight any where under his Gommand, and (if God would have it ſo) to die too. And truly many of them were reſolved, though to the certain hazard of their lives and eſtates, to follow him even againſt his Will and knowledge, and to offer him that ſervice in an unknown land which they were able to afford him no longer in their miſerable Country.</p>
               <p>By the Articles to which the King had conſented according to the deſires of the Covenanters, it was eſpecially provided, that
<hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould depart <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before the firſt of
<hi>September,</hi> and that they ſhould find him ſhipping, with proviſion and all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary when he went. Theſe things were tranſacted the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and a Port in <hi>Angus</hi> deſigned for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> whither they were to ſend ſhipping, from whence he was to embarque. And <hi>Montroſe,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all occaſions of exception or ſuſpition, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:116000:85"/> only with his own ſervants and a very few friends, betook himſelf thicher, and waited for the ſhipping. About this time his implacable enimies ſet abroad crafty and feigned Reports by their fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, wherein they confidently averred, that <hi>the States of the Kingdom</hi> (as they call'd themſelves) <hi>would by no means ſuffer that ſo gallant a Subject ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Country: For they knew not how great need they might have of a man of his worth, especially if the Ring, who had caſt himſelf freely upon the affections of the</hi> Scots,
<hi>could not get any right of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>but ſhould be put to ſeek it by Force and Armes; And if it came to that, no Age had afforded a better Generall than</hi> Montroſe. And truly that was the earneſt deſire and expectation of moſt men, who were not able to dive into the bottom of the Rebells Plots, but they had far other deſignes in hand, and another game to play. For what their thoughts were towards the King, the ſad event made too manifeſt. And for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> they laid very uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable and unworthy Traps to catch him. For they did this, that if they could flatter him up with ſuch vain hopes, and entice him to ſtay in the Kingdome beyond his time appointed, they might take hold of him upon the Articles, and cut him off with more credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> was almoſt ſpent, and no newes at all was to be had about the ſhipping or ſafe Conduct: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Montroſe,</hi> (although he was reſolved to be gone by the day the King had limited) that he might the more fully grope the intentions of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, gave leave for ſome of his friends to deal with them for further time. But when they brought him nought but doubtfull and uncertain anſwers, he had reaſon to think they intended nothing but to delude and intrap him. Beſides (which made his ſuſpition ſo much the greater) there came a ſhip upon the very
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:116000:86"/> laſt day allowed for his ſtay (to wit, on the laſt of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt)</hi> into the haven of <hi>Montroſe.</hi> The maſter of it was not only a ſtranger to him, but a moſt rude and violent abettor of the Rebels; the Sea-men and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, men of the ſame temper, malicious, dogged, and ill-condition'd, the ſhip it ſelf neither victualed, nor fit to goe to Sea. So that when <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to depart, and bad them horſe their ſails aſſoon as they could, the Maſter of the ſhip told him that he muſt have ſome dayes allowed him to pitch and rigge his ſhip, before he durſt adventure himſelf to the wind and waves. And then making great brags of himſelf and his ſhip, he drew forth a Commiſſion which the Covenanters had given him, wherein hee was required to tranſport the paſſengers to certain places aſſigned by themſelves, and to carry no body elſe. Moreover, there lay great Engliſh ſhips and men of Warre every day in ſight about the mouth of the river of <hi>Eske</hi> (which makes the haven of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe)</hi> attending there in favour of the Rebels for their much-deſired booty, that by no means he might eſcape their hands.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſufficient notice of theſe treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and wanted not ſome friends of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves, who informed him by frequent meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that the Sea was ſore peſter'd with the Engliſh Navy, and he could not eſcape ſafely either into
<hi>France</hi> or the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> that the haven was upon the matter block't up, in which he was to take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and therefore it was very perillous for him to goe to Sea; that his enemies look'd for nothing elſe, than that either by making too long ſtay in his own Country he ſhould fall into the hands of the Scotiſh Covenanters, or by going he ſhould be ſurpriſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd, and unawares by the Engliſh Rebells.
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe's</hi> friends that were with him were of opinion,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:116000:86"/> that it was beſt for him in ſo apparent a danger to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Highlands, and draw his men together again, conceiving that he had better truſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Warre, than ſo perfidious a peace. But he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to take that courſe, eſpecially becauſe of his moſt ardent affection to the King: For he was aſſured, if the Warre brake forth again, it would be laid upon the King though undeſervedly, and ſo he ſhould bring his Perſon into preſent danger, perhaps as much as his life was worth. Therefore being ſtraightned on every ſide, one way with treachery plotted againſt his own, another againſt the Kings anointed head, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an unalterable reſolution to bear all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon his own ſhoulders. And therefore he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf, not out of raſhneſſe, as if he deſpair'd of ſafety at the worſt, but out of ſage and diſcreet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
               <p>For when he had ſmelt out the plots of the Rebels before-hand, he had ſent ſome a good while agoe to ſearch diligently the havens in the North, and if they chanced to find any outlandiſh veſſell, to agree with the Maſter for the fraught, and to appoint him to be ready to put to ſea at ſuch a day, and to tranſport the paſſengers (which ſhould be ready with him) by the help of God into <hi>Norway.</hi> By good fortune there was found in the haven of <hi>Stanhyve,</hi> a ſmall bark of <hi>Bergen</hi> in
<hi>Norway,</hi> and the Maſter was ſoon agreed with, for he was very glad of the opportunity, having hopes of getting. Thither <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſent away Sir <hi>John Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, John Drummond</hi> of <hi>Ball, Henry Graham</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>John Spotſwood,</hi> nephew to that great Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, John Lily,</hi> a Captain of approved skill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, <hi>Patrick Melvin</hi> ſuch another, <hi>George Wiſcheart</hi> Doctor of Divinity,
<hi>David Guthercy</hi> a ſtout young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>Pardus Laſound,</hi> a French-man, once a ſervant to the noble Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> afterwards entertained for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:116000:87"/> his Maſters ſake by <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf, one <hi>Rodolph</hi> a German, an honeſt and truſty young man; and a few ſervants more. And theſe he had pick'd out to carry along with him whitherſoever he went, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon eſpecially, becauſe he knew the Rebels to be ſo maliciouſly bent againſt moſt of them, that they could not be ſafe for never ſo little a while in that Country. And they on the third of <hi>September</hi> having a good wind put forth to Sea for
<hi>Norway;</hi> and the ſame eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf, accompanied only with one <hi>James Wood,</hi> a worthy Preacher, by a ſmall cock-boat got into a bark which lay at anchor without the haven of
<hi>Montroſe;</hi> and being clad in a courſe ſuit, the Lord and Patron paſſed for his Chaplains ſervant. This was in the year of our Lord 1646. and the 34. year of his age.</p>

            <head>The Continuation of <hi>Montroſe's</hi> Hiſtorie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not our purpoſe in this addition to the Hiſtorie of the famous Marqueſſe, to deliver his ſeverall Negotiations with forreign Princes further than in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. For hoſoever they were in order to the Cauſe he had in hand, and did adde a great deal of luſtre and ſplendour to his worth, in the eyes of ſtrangers, who were indifferent in the caſe; As likewiſe it muſt be confeſſed, that no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Kingdome ever received higher favours abroad, or procur'd greater reſpect to the addreſſes made in his Maſters name; Yet theſe things being but obſcurely known in the Tenour of them, except only to thoſe who were employed, and indeed not ſo proper for our intention in this brief narration, which is to ſatisfie the curioſity of all in the manner of his laſt entrie, his defeat, death, and buriall, if (it may be ſo call'd) Things for ought I know as yet, ſet down in no certain relation: Wee ſhall therefore ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide his forreign endeavours, bring him upon that ſame ſtage where his Tragedie had both its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending. Only that you may have a more lively repreſentation of his perſonall vertues, we ſhall give you to underſtand in what high eſtimation the Marqueſſe was with forreign Princes, as well as with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:116000:88"/> thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and point at theſe honours which did ſeem to court his magnanimitie beyond the Seas. In <hi>France</hi> with the generall conſent of the Princes of the blood, and the reſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, he was deſign'd Captain Generall of all the ſtrangers in that kingdome; A truſt (which thoſe know that are acquainted with the warres of <hi>France)</hi> of very high conſequence, for in them conſiſts the whole ſtrength of the kingdome. But this advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Marqueſſes, was by Cardinall
<hi>Mazarini</hi> croſſed or delayd, (who was alwayes a profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to Scots in that kingdome.) From thence he took his journey to
<hi>Holland,</hi> where the Prince then was, in purſuit of his former intentions, but here he met with as great croſſes and impediments as he had done in the bowels of his own Country. Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> who was his irreconcilable enemie was now his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, and being then at the
<hi>Hague</hi> labour'd by all means poſſible to undermine or prevent the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes deſigns. With him were the Earl of <hi>Lauther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Calender,</hi> men both of eminent parts; whom the Duke by ſeverall engagements had made firm to his purpoſes; They were both very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for a Commiſſion. The Duke having intereſt in the Prince by blood, could not think that any in that truſt, could juſtly be preferrd before him; alleging likewiſe that he might be more able to perform any deſign in that kingdome, his kindred and allies, and thoſe of his Name being very powerfull, and in the very heart of the kingdome. Whereas
<hi>Montroſes</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whom he truſted moſt, and employed in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer action, were either kill'd or diſperſed; And thoſe whom he had left, ſo terrified, and ſqueezed in their eſtates, that they were utterly unable to help him. On the other part the Marqueſſes fidelitie pleaded much for him, his notable achievements, his poor and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:116000:88"/> ſlender beginnings, which made him ſo much the more capable for that undertaking, it being requiſite the Prince ſhould employ ſuch an inſtrument (as the caſe then ſtood) being deſtitute of all means to help him. The Prince who knew how needfull it was to reconcile two ſuch eminent Perſons, who being joyn'd might draw the greateſt part of that kingdome after them (fayling of which either of them was ſure to oppoſe the other that ſhould be employ'd,) made it it his main drift to unite them. Severall meetings were appointed to this purpoſe, but all in vain; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any induſtrie prevail to make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo inveterate was their malice each to other, ſo jealous were, they one of anothers proceedings. This variance made a long demur in that expedition, which was farre ſooner intended. The cauſes of which were partly ſet down in the beginning of the Hiſtorie, and partly hatched by the Duke himſelf, who looking, as he was a man very ambitious of honour, upon all the Marqueſſes actions with a ſquint eye, fretted much that there was any within the ſame kingdome, who ſo farre ſurpaſs'd him in gallantrie and eſteem: nor could he brook that any one ſhould poſſeſſe the Kings ear ſo much as he, and for theſe reaſons he employd his utmoſt endeavours in defeating all <hi>Montroſe's</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. But his Brothers known diſſervices, and bad ſucceſſe, together with his own neglect, or ill mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of buſineſſe at <hi>Strivling</hi> bridge, much retarded and obſcured his claym to the Kings favour, in the particular he ſought for. And to ſpeak impartially, the Marqueſſes worth and experience was ſuch, that it did eaſily ſway the ballance in any indifferent mans judgement, even though the other two had been thrown in to make up the weight. The Marqueſſe having againſt his will ſpent a great deal of time in theſe diſputes, departed at laſt from <hi>Holland,</hi> and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:116000:89"/> travell'd up into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour who in his late warres againſt the
<hi>Swede,</hi> hath been very unſucceſsfull, hearing of his arrivall, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to his Court, and amongſt many other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours conferr'd upon him, freely proferr'd him the Command of ten thouſand men; which ſhould be a ſtanding Army, conſtantly to be recruited; With free power to engage at his own diſcretion, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving orders from any but the Emperour himſelf. Which charge the marqueſſe being willing to accept, and about to receive, (yet rather that he might if it were poſſible advance that cauſe which he had in hand, than for any deſire of honour) he was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that happy peace concluded betwixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which all who love the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of Chriſtendome, wiſh to be laſting and perpetuall. Being from thence very honourably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd, he addreſſes himſelf to the Dukes of <hi>Brande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> and <hi>Holſteyn;</hi> from the laſt of which, he receiv'd thoſe ſhips which were kept a great while at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to no purpoſe, being three or four very fair Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and well mann'd. Which Prince would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly contributed more to that ſervice, but that he perceiv'd that which he had before given, to be ſo miſemployed; wherein both he and the Marqueſſe were groſsly abus'd, as in the enſuing relation ſhall appear. Great were the promiſes which had been made to the Marqueſſe by many other Princes, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very ſlack in the performance, ſo that the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which was ſo generally expected, proved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a meer formalitie and complement. But the ſeaſon of the year being now fit for Action, he reſolves with what ſpeed he can, to call together thoſe which he could get, and to that purpoſe removes to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> from whence he might have a convenient paſſage to the Northern Iſles of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But ere we
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:116000:89"/> further proceed, it will not be imperrinent to our purpoſe, to take a ſlender view of that kingdom, whither this expedition was intended, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein it then was.
<hi>Scotland</hi> was then in a reaſonable poſture of quiet, for the old grudges by taking away the heads of factions, (whereof ſome had ſuffer'd after <hi>Philip Haugh,</hi> and others were detain'd Priſoners in
<hi>England)</hi> were rak'd up for a while. And a certain number of Horſe and Foot modell'd into an Armie, was muſter'd and diſpos'd of in ſeverall places of the kingdome, to prevent any forreign inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or any homebred inſurrection which might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Theſe were commanded by <hi>David Leſley,</hi> Collonel <hi>Mountgomerie,</hi> Col. <hi>Straughan, &amp;c.</hi> being in all fifteen hundred Horſe, and three thouſand Foot commanded by Lieut. Generall <hi>Holborn.</hi> This handfull did at that time over-awe and keep under the diſcontented par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though farre more powerfull. For beſides thoſe which had been disbanded by the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> and Major Generall <hi>Munroe,</hi> at the bridge of <hi>Striveling,</hi> there flock'd daily out of <hi>England</hi> great companies of thoſe who had eſcaped out of Priſon; who finding their eſtates Sequeſtred, and ſeiz'd upon, and withall moſt tyrannically proceeded againſt by the hot-ſpirited Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, deſired nothing more than an opportunitie of revenge. Beſides theſe he had a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his own name, and faction in the North. The <hi>Gordons,</hi> the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, who (if he had not been cruſh'd at his firſt entrie) would certainly have aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him. This conditiun of the kingdome, made the Marqueſſe appear like a prodigious Mereor hanging over their heads, which awak'd thoſe who ſate at the helm of the State (whom it did indeed moſt concern) to endeavour the defeating of his attempts both at home and abroad. For this purpoſe was there a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Meſſage diſpatch'd to the Prince, then Reſident
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:116000:90"/> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> whom preſently upon the News of his Fathers death they had proclam'd King, inviting him home upon certain conditions which were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in this kingdome, and need not therefore be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferted. In the mean time the Marqueſſe who had now gathered together a companie of gallant Gentlemen, aſwell Engliſh as Scots, makes all poſſible haſt, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches Collonel <hi>John Oglebie</hi> to
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch ſtrangers as might be for his purpoſe. But he forgeting his Commiſſion, beſtowed both moneys and pains in entertaining himſelf, ſuffering thoſe who upon any termes would have engaged to ſhift for themſelves. There being a great number who had fled out of <hi>England,</hi> and more who had lately deſerted the
<hi>French,</hi> or been caſhier'd from the Hollanders ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Thus were theſe goodly Veſſells ſufficiently provided for ſervice loſt by his neglect, and a limb of the deſign broken. There happen'd about this time another buſineſſe, which did much retard the Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes affairs. Collonel <hi>Cochran</hi> who had been diſpatch'd Commiſſioner into
<hi>Poland</hi> to the Scotiſh Merchants there to require their aſſiſtance, having procur'd very conſiderable ſumms of money upon that ſcore, and other proviſion for the furthering of that expedition, diſpos'd of the money for his own uſes, made ſale of the corn and proviſion, together with the veſſell which was provided for the tranſportation of it, and did himſelf turn tayl to the quarrell. This was another diſappointment. Generall <hi>King</hi> likewiſe (whom the Marqueſſe expected out of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with a conſiderable party of Horſe) either could not be ready ſo ſoon as was expected, or elſe delayd the time of purpoſe. But the Marqueſſe (as is ſuppoſed) fearing leſt he ſhould have an expreſſe command to deſiſt from his purpoſe, becauſe the Treaty betwixt the Prince and the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Commiſſioners was now very neer a concluſion,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116000:90"/> did precipitate himſelf, and thoſe that were with him, into moſt inevitable ruine. Now all thoſe great lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and aydes; Thoſe mighty preparations for the invaſion of a kingdome ſettled in a poſture of warre, and well forwarn'd of his intentions, amounted not above the number of ſix or ſeven hundred at the moſt, ſtrangers and all. The common ſouldiers which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur'd over with him, moſt of them <hi>Holſteyners</hi> or <hi>Hamburgers.</hi> He had ſent him by the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the arming of ſuch Gentlemen as ſhould upon his arrivall betake themſelves to his partie, fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred arms, compleat for Horſe, back, breſt, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, Carrabines, Piſtolls, and Swords, all which, (after his defeat in <hi>Cathanes)</hi> were taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd. With this ſmall preparation it was a deſperate action to attempt ſo mightie a buſineſſe. And although his touching firſt upon the Iſlands, did encreaſe his number, and gave him almoſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an Armie; Yet were thoſe barbarous people ſo raw and unacquainted with diſcipline, that they prov'd in a manner uſeleſſe and unſerviceable.
'Tis true; the Inhabitants of thoſe Iſles, were a people in former times, very fierce, and warlike, and have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own Captains made many great Impreſſions, into the very heart of the kingdome. But whether it was the Policie of the late Kings, to leave them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train'd of purpoſe, to break their naturall fierceneſſe, or becauſe their own Captains being quell'd or cut off, they cared not much to engage under any another; certain it is, That kingdome for two hundred years laſt paſt, hath not made leſſe uſe of any they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their juriſdiction, nor have they at this preſent, leſſe opinion of any Scots, for Military courage and valour. And this may be alleged, as a great cauſe of their remiſsneſſe and unwieldineſſe whilſt they were in the Marqueſſes ſervice. I told you a little before of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116000:91"/> 
               <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s whole Strength, which did accompany him from <hi>Germanie,</hi> whereof two ſhips, with neer upon a third part were ſent before, but by ſtorm of weather (which is both frequent and dangerous) amongſt thoſe Northern Iſlands, they were loſt with all the men and arms, nothing ſav'd. This was another check, and as it were a warning &amp; a fore-runner of the ſad event which followed. But the buſineſſe being fatall, he muſt needs contribute his own endeavours towards that deſtruction which his cruell fortune had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him. For he nothing terrified with this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſends out a ſecond partie, which making a more proſperous voyage, landed at <hi>Orkney,</hi> and enter'd the Iſland without any reſiſtance. There being at that time no Garriſon or defence placed in any of thoſe Iſlands, by the States of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> Together with theſe he ſent ſeverall Commiſſions for levying of Horſe and Foot; Immediatly there were ſeverall diſpatch'd to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Iſlands adjacent for that purpoſe. The people of the Countrie being in no condition to reſiſt theſe officers, endeavoured in hopes of favour as much as they could to further the deſign. And thoſe who were not ſo earneſt, were by their own neighbours favourers of the cauſe, and theſe violent Commiſſioners, forc'd to take up Arms. Not long after landed the Marqueſſe himſelf with the reſt of his companie, together with thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which reſolv'd to partake of his fortune; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom were ſeverall perſons of note. Collonel
<hi>Hurry</hi> was there, a man who had engaged in all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, but never proſper'd in any. The Lord <hi>Frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> for his kinſman the Lord
<hi>Napier,</hi> was left in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Collonel <hi>Jonſon</hi> a reſolute man, and an old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, Coll. <hi>Gray</hi> a German ſouldier, <hi>Harry Grahame,</hi> his own naturall brother, Coll. <hi>James Hay</hi> of <hi>Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgetie, George Drummond</hi> of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:116000:91"/> 
               <hi>Ballach.</hi> For he had employed as was thought, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sibbalds</hi> his companion heretofore, as his Agent in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> But he was apprehended at <hi>Muſſelburgh,</hi> and did accompanie his Generall in death upon the ſame Scaffold. The Marqueſſe continued a conſiderable time in <hi>Orkney,</hi> raiſing of Forces, and ſtrenghning himſelf with ſuch recruits, as the place would afford. Neither was there any preparation at all made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to diſpoſſeſſe him of theſe Iſlands, either becauſe it might be thought a difficult buſineſſe to aſſail him within thoſe places naturally guarded with a rough and dangerous Sea; O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> becauſe they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtrength, expected a better opportunitie of him, as they found indeed within the Countrie.</p>
            <p>After this poor rabble of ſilly creatures was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd, He reſolves at laſt to embarque, and to that purpoſe gathers all the boats he could find, ſhips his men, and in a ſhort ſpace lands them all upon the point of <hi>Cathanes,</hi> which is the fartheſt land to the Northweſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The people having ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the carriage of his former Souldierie, and now farre more dreading the name of Forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, partly by the terrible reports which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly given out of him, fled away in heaps, many of them not ſtopping till they came to the chief City
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there gave the terrible Alarm to the Parliament then ſitting. The Commanders were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſummond, and charg'd with all poſſible haſt, to get the ſtanding Forces in readineſs, and a rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in order to the States command was hereupon preſently enjoyn'd, at <hi>Breithen</hi> Northward. Collonel <hi>Straughan,</hi> who was then in high eſteem with the great ones for his valour lately expreſſed in the Engliſh ſervice, and his zeal to the Presbyterian cauſe much extoll'd at that time, had an ample, and a particular Commiſſion granted to him by the Parliament, to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:116000:92"/> command a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoyce party of Horſe, which ſhould not be ſubject to <hi>David Leſleys</hi> orders, but might engage and fight with the enemy at his beſt advantage. With theſe, being not above three hundred, he advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Armie; <hi>David Leſlie</hi> with the reſt of the Horſe, and <hi>Holborn</hi> with the Foot marching after him. In the mean time the Marqueſſe advanc'd but very ſlowly, and that he might not be miſtaken, (ſince all the world was much aſtoniſh'd at this Invaſion now whilſt the King was upon a Treatie) he publiſhed a Declaration; Wherein he labour'd to clear himſelf of any aſperſion of ſiniſter ends. That his intention was only againſt ſome particular perſons, who had againſt the Laws of the kingdome, rais'd and maintain'd a warre againſt the Kings Father, and did now by their ſubtile practices endeavour to deſtroy the Son alſo. That he intended nothing againſt the Generalitie of the Kingdome. Laſtly, exhorting all ſubjects of that Nation to endeavour to free themſelves from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of thoſe who for the preſent ruled the State, and the oppreſſion of the Miniſtrie. But the Country for ſeverall cauſes did not come to ſecond him as hee expected. For the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> a potent man in thoſe parts, his lands being next to the place where the Marqueſſe then was, rais'd a great power of his Tenants and friends, and did his beſt to terrifie and hinder all that were willing to joyn with him. And though he found himſelf unable to deal with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes forces, yet did he ſtop all entercourſe betwixt him and his friends. And thoſe Gentlemen who had heretofore followed him, and yet enclined to aſſiſt him, knowing the danger of the enterpriſe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fewneſſe of his number, and that his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were much undiſciplin'd, and unlike to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with whom he had done ſo great things, began to be averſe, and have a ſuſpition of the event. Yet have
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116000:92"/> I heard ſome ſay which knew well enough the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Country, That if he had not been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the nick, he might have gain'd ſuch ſtrengths amongſt the hills, as might have given him leiſure enough to have ſtrengthned his own partie, and tyred out the enemy. Howſoever he was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unmindfull of a retreat; There is in that Country a Caſtle call'd <hi>Dumbath,</hi> the Lord, or Laird thereof, is the head of a very ancient Familie, but no friend of the Marqueſſes. This Gentleman having left his houſe in the keeping of his Lady and ſome ſervants, fled to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Lady, though the place were naturally fortified, yet upon ſummons delivered it to Collonel
<hi>Hurry,</hi> who was ſent thither by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe with a partie of Foot to reduce it, Upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her goods and eſtate might be ſecur'd, and ſhe with her ſervants ſuffor'd to march away. <hi>Hurry</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plac'd a Governour, and a Garriſon as hee thought ſufficient for the defence of the place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Marqueſſe, who was now advanc'd to the place, or neer it, where he was to loſe at one throw both his life and fortune. The Marqueſſe hearing of the enemies approach, made his whole Forces march at a great trot to recover a paſſe, which they were not very farre from, when he himſelf in the vanguard diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the firſt partie which was <hi>Straughans</hi> Forlorn hope advancing very faſt upon him. So that theſe with their haſt, and the ſouldiers running, found them both out of breath and order. The ſecond Partie was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by
<hi>Straughan</hi> himſelf, and the

               </gap>ereguard as I remember by Collonel <hi>Ker,</hi> for he had divided them in three bodies. But now the firſt party being very neer, there was a Forlorn hope of a hundred Foot drawn out to meet them, who giving fire upon them, put them to a diſorderly retreat, but being immediatly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by <hi>Straughans</hi> partie, they made good their
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:116000:93"/> charge, and ſo terrified the Iſlanders with that breach, that moſt of them threw down their Arms, and call'd for quarter. Only the Dutch Companies, after they had beſtowed a volley or two amongſt the Horſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into ſome ſhrubbs hard by, and there very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly defended themſelves awhile, but were all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at laſt. There were kill'd in this buſineſſe to the number of two hundred, twelve hundred taken, very few eſcaped. For the whole Countrie being in Arms, eſpecially <hi>Sunderlands</hi> men (who came not to the fight, but to the execution) they kill'd or took Priſoners all ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fled. In that skirmiſh was taken the Standard which he had caus'd to be made of purpoſe to move the affections of the people, with this Motto, <hi>Judge and revenge my cauſe, O Lord;</hi> and the portraict of the late King beheaded exactly well done. The Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, a very gallant young Gentleman was kill'd, after he had ſeverall times refus'd quarter. There was Collonel <hi>Hurrey</hi> taken, the Lord
<hi>Frenderick,</hi> Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgetie;</hi> Collonel

            <p>The Marqueſſe after he ſaw the day was abſolutely loſt, threw away his cloak, which had the Starre on it, (having receiv'd the order of the Garter a little while before) his Sword was likewiſe found, and not very farre off his horſe which he had forſaken.

But ſuch narrow ſearch being made for him, he could not long eſcape, yet he continued in the open fields three or four dayes without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice gotten of him. At laſt the Lord of <hi>Aſton,</hi> being in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:116000:93"/> Arms with ſome of his Tenants and aboard in that ſearch, happened on him. He had been one of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers before. In that place he had continued three or four dayes, without meat or drink, with one only man in his company. The Marqueſſe knowing him, and believing to find friendſhip at his hands, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover'd himſelf. But <hi>

'Tis ſayd he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great ſummes for his libertie, which being in vain, he deſir'd to dye by the hands of thoſe who took him, rather than be made an object of miſerie and ſhame (as he knew very well he ſhould) by his enraged enemies. But neither of his deſires was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but in place of them, a ſtrong guard ſet over him, and ſo convey'd to <hi>David Leſley. Straughan</hi> having archiev'd his buſineſſe with great expedition, and freed the State from this much-fear'd danger, return'd to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> leaving the reſt of the buſineſſe to <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and
<hi>Holborn,</hi> where he receiv'd great rewards and thanks for his eminent ſervice; not without the great heart-burning of <hi>David Leſley,</hi> who ſeeing a rivall riſen up to his honour, and one whom he lookt upon as an upſtart ſouldier, have ſo great ſucceſſe, fretted not a little. Howſoever forwards he moves to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the reſt of the work, which was now of no great conſequence, for there reſted nothing within the Countrie, but only the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbath,</hi>

               </gap>hich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of all hopes of relief after the defeat, ſo ſoon as they were perfectly aſſur'd by ſome Priſoners whom they knew, yielded the Garriſon. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was Priſoner at mercy; The ſouldiers being Dutch, were upon termes to return homewards. There was nothing elſe to be done ſave the reducing of the Iſlands, and the Town of <hi>Kirkwall</hi> in
<hi>Orkney,</hi> where
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:116000:94"/> Collonel <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and Coll.

               </hi> likewiſe, elſe both of them had taſted of the ſame ſawce which their Generall did. Thus
<hi>Leſleys</hi> forces entred without any reſiſtance, ſeiz'd upon the Arms which <hi>Montroſe</hi> had brought thither, together with two pieces of Ordnance. The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> had given him a little Friggot of ſixteen gunns which lay in the Harbour, the Maſter of which being gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore into one of the Iſlands, the Company ſeeing the event of the buſineſſe, revolted, and brought in that likewiſe. The victory being now compleat, there was a ſolemn day of thankſgiving appointed through the whole Kingdome, Bonfires, ſhooring of Ordnance, and other teſtimonies of joy. But many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie who had been under his command before, having now engaged with him again, were no partakers in this joy. For ſome of his Papers being taken, many of them were afterwards diſcovered, and ſuffer'd in their eſtates. The Marqueſſe being now in the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of his mortall enemies, from whom he could not expect the leaſt favour, Yet expreſt a ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, and in a manner a careleſneſſe of his own condition. Comming to his Father-in-laws houſe, the Earl of
<hi>Southesks,</hi> where two of his children were, he procur'd liberty from his Guard to ſee them: but neither at meeting, or parting, could any change of his former countenance be diſcerned, or the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion heard, which was not ſuitable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:116000:94"/> of his ſpirit, and the ſame of his former actions. 'Tis memorable of the Town of <hi>Dundee,</hi> where hee lodg'd one night, though it had ſuffer'd more by his Army than any elſe within that kingdome, yet were they amongſt all the reſt ſo farre from inſulting over him, that the whole Town teſtified a great deal of ſorrow for his wofull condition; and there was hee likewiſe furniſhed with cloathes ſuitable to his birth and perſon. Being come to <hi>Leith,</hi> he was received by the Magiſtrates of the Citie of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſtaying awhile there to refreſh himſelf, he was afterward led towards the City, by that way which goes betwixt <hi>Leith,</hi> and the water-gate of the Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ey. And with him all the Priſoners of qualitie on foot, betwixt thirty and fourty: but he himſelf had the favour to be mounted on a cart-horſe. Having ended this part of his journey with as much ſtate as in triumphs is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be, he was met at the end of the Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by ſome other Officers, and the Executioner in his Liverie Coat. Into whoſe hands he was delivered. There was fram'd for him a high ſeat in faſhion of a Chariot, upon each ſide of which were holes, through which a cord being drawn, and croſſing his breſt and arms, bound him faſt down in the Chayre. The Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner (being commanded ſo to doe) took off the Marqueſſes hat, put on his own bonnet, and the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot being drawn by four horſes, he mounted one of the firſt, and very ſolemnly began to drive along towards the tol-booth. The people who were aſſembled in great multitudes, and were many of them heretofore very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee this ſpectacle, could not now refrain from tears, and thoſe who had heretofore wiſh'd him all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, began to be ſhaken with the firſt ſeene of his Tragedie. But the implacable Miniſtrie having him now at their mercie, could never be ſatisfied w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th his calamities; They reviled him with all poſſible ſpite,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:116000:95"/> objected frequently to him his former condition, and his preſent miſerie, and pronounced heavie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt him; being come to the Toll-booth, hee was very cloſely ſhut up, and ſtrong guards ſet upon him, all acceſſe denyed to him; no, not his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, or any of his friends ſuffer'd to come n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gh him. There he was a conſiderable time, all which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters never ceas'd to exacerbate his miſerie. Of whom one being asked why they could not otherwiſe be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but by ſo ignominious handling of him? He anſwered, They knew no other way to humble him, and bring him home to God.</p>
            <p>Certain it was, that all theſe diſgraces which were put upon him, were the only inventions of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie then ſitting, to whoſe wiſdomes the deviſing of his puniſhment was referr'd by the Councell of State. All this while the holy Covenant was preſs'd upon him with much vehemencie, which when he with much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and conviction to them refus'd, they had recourſe to their ordinary way of rayling, and malediction, and one of them was ſo bold to tell him, he was a faggot of hell, and he ſaw him burning there already. They urg'd alſo upon him as the price of his releaſment from excommunication, an open confeſſion of his faults, and an acknowledgement of the guilt of blood which had been ſhed the years paſt in which he had been in Arms; but all to no purpoſe. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly (becauſe the battell of <hi>Kilſyth</hi> had been loſt upon ſo great odds) he was much ſolicited to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Conſpiratours in the overthrow of that Army, but that took no effect; nor is that yet (ſince he left it undiſcover'd) known to any Scotiſh man alive, whether there were any connivance in't or no. He was very frequent in his devotions, whilſt he was in priſon, and expreſt much more cheerfulneſſe than he had done at any time before ſince his being taken priſoner.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:116000:95"/> After he had endur'd theſe private batteries and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, with a great deal of conſtancie, he was at laſt brought before a publike auditorie to be ſifted. The Parliament had a little while before been call'd, for proclaming the King, and ordering the affairs of the kingdome: whither he was brought, and did appear with a very undiſmayd countenance, in a rich Mantle layd over with maſſie lace. His chief adverſaries were, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle,</hi> his known and inveterate enemie; Earl of <hi>Lowdon,</hi> the Chancellour of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> of the ſame name and faction, <hi>Lowdon Ker,</hi> a violent and a high-ſpirited man; <hi>Caſſells,</hi> another of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, was gone in Commiſſion to the King. Theſe of the Nobilitie were moſt againſt him; Of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, the Laird of
<hi>Swinton,</hi> a potent man in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; Sir <hi>James Stuart,</hi> Provoſt of the Citie of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a man likewiſe in great eſteem; The Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> a Lord of the Seſſion, and Preſident of the Committee for Examinations, and ſeverall others. But the whole Aſſembly was violent againſt him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he be admitted to any place there, that was not publikely invective againſt him. But amongſt them all the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in this ſtrife car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the honour, and of them Mr. <hi>Robert Trayle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mungo Law,</hi> two ſuch venemous Preachers, as no man that knows them can mention their names with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deteſt. The firſt of the two, had been Chaplain before to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in his flight from the battell of
<hi>Ennerlochie,</hi> and now Priſoner to the States of <hi>England.</hi> Many and grievous were the accuſations layd to his charge. Firſt, that he had by his pernicious inſinuation diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King from the Counſells of his well-wiſhing Subjects. The introducing the Iriſh into the bowells of the Kingdome. The murther of ſome particular perſons, the utter ſpoyl and devaſtation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:116000:96"/> of <hi>Argyles</hi> lands, and the Killing and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers well-affected people there, and that in cold blood. The cruell uſage of ſome miniſters at his laſt landing. The Complainers were there preſent, but could allege nothing ſave only that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayn'd them from rayling. His tranſacting with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign States for the invaſion of his Native Country, and bringing in of Forreigners now the ſecond time, and that without any known Commiſſion. His obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſecution of all Covenanters, againſt his own oath and engagement, and his Apoſtacie from his firſt principles. The Marqueſſe knowing how much his defences would avail him, did not much labour to clear himſelf, but anſwer'd all in generall. For his Invaſion they knew partly what authoritie he had, for the reſt he was ſufficiently perſwaded in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he had done nothing, which he might not be anſwerable to God for, as being in order to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Commands, and to men too, ſo he might have but an even and an unprejudic'd judicatorie. Thus having been call'd once or twice before that high Court of judgement, where he anſwer'd ſo vigorouſly as was admirable to all, he did at laſt receive his dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sentence, which was accordingly executed upon him two dayes after, with all the ſeveritie and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that could be deviſed. There was erected in the middle of the Market-place a large Scaffold, breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high, in the midſt of which, was planted a Gibbet of extraordinary height. The Marqueſſe having taken his reſt very kindly that night, next morning recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending himſelf to God once or twice, took his breakfaſt very chearfully. The Bayliffs waited on him to the Scaffold, where the whole people of the City attended his comming at leaſt two houres before. He came uncovered all the way betwixt the Scaffold and the Toll-booth, and in the ſame rich Mantle he had
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:116000:96"/> worn before. Being come thither, he was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn'd with a great many frivolous queſtions, of which partly the Miniſters, partly thoſe whom the States ſuffer'd to be about him, deſir'd to be ſatisfied. Hee made a ſhort Speech, in which he was often interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Tenour of which was, That he was ſatisfied in his conſcience for ought he had done in relation to warre. That for his own particular ſins (which were infinite) he had begg'd pardon earneſtly of God, and had an inward hope to obta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n it; Hee freely forgave all thoſe who had ſought his overthrow, and intreated the Charitie of all the people to pray both for him and them. The Miniſters, becauſe he was under the ſentence of Excommunication, refus'd to pray for him, and even on the very Scaffold, were very bitter againſt him. After he had about a quarter of an hour prayed with his hat before his eyes, he was ready to goe to his ſuffering, when his Book and Declaration, and all other Papers which he had publiſh'd in his life, being tyed in a ſtring together, were hang'd about his neck. He was very earneſt that he might have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to keep on his hat, it was denyed; He requeſted he might have the priviledge to keep his cloak about him, neither could that be granted. Then with a moſt undaunted courage he went up to the top of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious gibbet, where having freely pardon'd the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, he gave him three or four pieces of gold, and enquir'd of him how long he ſhould hang there, he told him three hours, then commanding him at the uplifting of his hands, to tumble him over, he was accordingly thruſt off by the weeping Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The whole people gave a generall groan, and it was very obſervable, that even thoſe who at his firſt appearance had bitterly inveigh'd againſt him, could not now abſtain from tears. 'Tis ſaid, that
<hi>Argyles</hi> expreſſions had ſomething of grief in them, and did
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:116000:97"/> likewiſe weep at the rehearſall of his death, (for he was not preſent at the execution.) Howſoever they were by many call'd Crocodiles tears, how worthily I leave to others judgement. But I am ſure there did in his ſon, the Lord of <hi>Lorne,</hi> appear no ſuch ſign, who neither had ſo much tenderneſſe of heart to be ſorry, nor ſo much paternall wit as to diſſemble; who entertaining his new Bride, (the Earl of <hi>Murrays</hi> Daughter) with this ſpectacle, mock'd and laugh'd in the midſt of that weeping Aſſemblie: And ſtaying afterwards to ſee him hewen in pieces, triumph'd at every ſtroak which was beſtow'd upon his mangled body. Thus ended the life of the Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Marqueſſe, though not his puniſhment, (if that can properly be call'd a puniſhment which mens bodies ſuffer after death.) For being cut down, without ſo much as any to receive his falling corps, His head was ſmitten off, his arms by the ſhoulders, and his leggs by the knees, and ſo put into ſeverall boxes, made for the purpoſe; the reſt of his body was by three or four Porters, carried out to the publique place of execution, call'd the <hi>Borrow moore,</hi> anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of <hi>Tyborn</hi> by <hi>London,</hi> but wall'd about, and and there was it thrown into a hole, where afterwards it was digg'd up by night, and the linnen in which it was folded ſtoln away. His head was fix'd upon the Toll-booth, over againſt the Earl of
<hi>Gowries,</hi> with an Iron Croſſe over it, leſt by any of his friends it ſhould have been taken down; the reſt of his parts were diſpatch'd to the moſt eminent places of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to <hi>Sterling, Dundee, Glaſgow, Aberdene,</hi> which were all taken down afterwards by the Engliſh, or their permiſſion. But the Tragedie was not yet full, for <hi>Hurrie</hi> was the next in that bloody roll, who plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefit of quarter, and a great charge of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thought to have taſted of the Parliaments mercy.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116000:97"/> But he was condemn'd notwithſtanding, to loſe his head in the ſame place. Jealous they were of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he was engaged in their ſervice againſt <hi>Montroſe,</hi> but could not produce any ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The chief accuſations wherewith he was charg'd, the laſt Invaſion with the Marqueſſe, and his former carrying Arms againſt them under Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>Marſton Moore.</hi> With him ſuffer'd young <hi>Spotſwood</hi> of <hi>Daerſie,</hi> a compleat young Gentleman, and very worthy of pitty, (if any had been ſhown) being very young, but an excellent ſpirit, and a good Scholar. The next couple was Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſie,</hi> and Collonel
<hi>Sibbalds:</hi> then which two the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not afford two more accompliſh'd for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and parts. The firſt being a Catholick, (and therefore not comming under the compaſſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Prayers) without ſpeaking a word to any body, but throwing ſome Papers out of his pocket, took off his doublet, kiſs'd the fatall Inſtrument, kneel'd down, and receiv'd the blow. The other with a little more vigour, ſmil'd a while, and talk'd to the diſorderly rabble that was about him: then with ſuch an heroick geſture march'd to the block, as if he had been to act a gallant in a Play. The end of the laſt man was ſomewhat Comicall, though the poor Gentleman loſt his life. His name was Captain <hi>Charters</hi> of an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and antient Familie in that kingdome. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters having dealt with him to acknowledge his fault publikely, and dehort all others from it (which from no other of his companions they could ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort) he though reſolute enough, and a good Scholar, yet partly by the perſwaſion of his friends, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by weakneſſe which was occaſion'd by his wounds, agreed to their deſire, and was content to make a publique Manifeſto in hopes his life might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. With this conqueſt of conſcience, the Miniſters
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:116000:98"/> (to produce their great work to the Common people) came vaunting upon the Scaffold. Hee all this while ſuſpecting nothing leſſe then death made a long and tedious <hi>Harangue</hi> to the people, wherein he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Apoſtacie from the Covenant, and other things which he had vented in auricular confeſſion before to the Miniſters; which very energetically they had pend for him. In leiu of granting his life which he expected, (leſt he ſhould fall off from his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he had openly profeſſed as ſome of their converts had done before) fairly they cutt off his head; and ſeal'd his confeſſion with his blood. The reſt being for the moſt part ſtrangers, or ſuch as had ſpent moſt part of their time in ſervice abroad, were diſmiſs'd, after bond given not to enter the kingdome again, in a hoſtile manner.</p>

            <p>THe Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe</hi> was taken, and fore-ſeeing that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and carriage might gain him ſome favour amongſt the People, thought fit to give out their ſentence againſt him before he ſhould come to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> And therefore upon the 17. of <hi>May anno</hi> 1650. in the morning, they appointed a Committee to prepare and give in their opinions what was fitteſt to be done with him, where the ſame fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon they gave in their report in writing to this effect: That ſo ſoon as he ſhould come to the Town, he ſhould be met at the Gate by the Magiſtrates, and Hangman; That he ſhould be tyed with cords upon a Cart bareheaded, and the Hangman to ride upon the horſe that drew the Cart, covered before him, and ſo to be brought through the Town. That he ſhould be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:116000:99"/> hanged on a gibbet at the Croſſe of
<hi>Edenburgh</hi> untill he died, his Hiſtorie, and Declaration hanging about his neck, and ſo hang three hours in publike view of all the people: after which he ſhould be beheaded, and quartered. His head to be fixt upon the Priſon houſe of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and his leggs and arms over the gates of the Cities of <hi>Sterling, Glaſcowe, Ferth,</hi> alias Saint
<hi>Johns-Town</hi> and <hi>Aberdeine.</hi> And in caſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not, (whereby the Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be taken off by the Church): the bulk of his body ſhould be buried in the <hi>Gray-friers;</hi> if not, to be buried in the Boromoore,</p>
            <p>Upon the 18. day about four a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, he was brought in at the Water-gate, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sentence was met by the Magiſtrates, the guards, and the Hangman of the Citie, the reſt of the Priſoners being tyed two and two together, going bareheaded before him. So ſoon as he came within the gate, the Magiſtrates ſhewed him the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which when he had read, and perceived the Cart, and Hangman there ready, he ſaid; <hi>Hee would willingly obey, he was only ſorry that through him, hu Majeſtie whoſe perſon he preſented, ſhould be ſo diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Then going cheerfully into the Cart, he being uncovered, was by the Hangman tyed thereunto with ropes, and the Hangman on the horſe rid covered, thus was he carried to the Priſon, and in all the way, there appeared in him ſuch a <hi>Majeſtie, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Modeſtie,</hi> no way <hi>Daunted,</hi> That his very Enemies, nay common women, who as it was beleeved by divers would have ſtoned him in the Cart as he paſſed, were upon the ſight of him ſo aſtoniſhed, and moved: that their intended curſes, were turned into tears and Prayers for him; Inſomuch as the next day (being Sunday), the Miniſters preached againſt them for not reviling and ſtoning of him as he paſſed along.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:116000:99"/> When he was taken from the Cart, he gave the Hangman gold, telling him, <hi>That was a reward for driving the Cart:</hi> It was ſeven a clock at night before he was entered into the Priſon, and immediatly the Parliament met, and ſent ſome of their Members, and ſome Miniſters to examine him; but he refuſed to anſwer any thing to them, untill he was ſatisfied upon what tearms they ſtood with the King, his Royall Maſter. Which being reported unto the Parliament, they ceaſed proceeding againſt him untill Monday, and allowed their Commiſſioners to tell him that the King, and they were agreed: He deſired to be at reſt, for he was weary with a long journey, and he ſaid, <hi>The Complement they had put upon him that day was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tedious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being Sunday, he was conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Miniſters and Parliament-men, who ſtill perſued him with threatnings, but they got no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him; he told them, <hi>They thought they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted him the day before by carrying him in a cart, but they were much miſtaken; For he thought it the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and joyful'ſt journey that ever he made, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the while moſt comfortably manifeſted his preſence to him, and furniſhing him with reſolution to ever-look the reproches of men, and to behold him, for whoſe cauſe he ſuffered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Monday in the forenoon, he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament, and after the deliverie of a long penned diſcourſe by the Chancellour wherein he was pleaſed to take notice of <hi>his miſcarriages againſt the firſt Covenant, the League and Covenant, his Invaſion, and joyning with the Iriſh Rebells, and blood-guiltineſs; and that now, how God had brought him to just puniſhment:</hi> Hee deſired to know if he might be allowed to ſpeak for himſelf, which being granted, he ſaid, <hi>Since you have declared unto me, that you have agreed with the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116000:100"/> King, I look upon you, as if his Majeſtie were ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you; and in that Relation I appear with this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence bareheaded: My care hath been alwaies to walk as became a good Chriſtian, and a loyall Subject; I engaged in the firſt Covenant, and was faithfull to it, untill I perceived ſome private perſons under colour of Religion intended to wring the Authoritie from the King, and to ſeize on it for themſelves; and when it was thought fit for the clearing of honeſt men that a bond ſhould be ſubſcribed, wherein the ſecuritie of Religion was ſufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, I ſubſcribed. For the League and Covenant, I thank God I was never in it, and ſo could not break it, but how farre Religion hath been advanced by it, and the ſad conſequences that have followed on it, theſe poore diſtreſſed Kingdomes can witneſs; for when his late Majeſtie had by the bleſſing of God almoſt ſubdued thoſe enemies that roſe againſt him in</hi> England, <hi>and that a faction of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome went in to the aſſiſtance of them. His Majeſty gave Commiſſion to me, to come into this Kingdome, and to make a diverſion of thoſe forces that were going from hence againſt Him, I acknowledged the command moſt juſt, and I conceiv'd my ſelf bound in conſcience and duty to obey it, what my carriage was in this Countrey many of you may bear witneſſe; Diſorders in any Army cannot be prevented, but they were no ſooner known, then puniſhed; never was any mans blood ſpilt but in Battell, and even then many thouſand lives have I preſerved; and as I came in upon his Majeſties Warrant, ſo upon his Letters did I lay aſide all intereſt, and retreat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for my comming in at this time, it was by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties commands, in order to the accelerating of the Treaty betwixt him and you; His Majeſtie knowing that when ever he had ended with you, I was ready to retire upon his call, I may juſtly ſay, that never ſubject acted upon more Honourable grounds, nor by ſo lawfull a power, as I did in this ſervice; and therefore I deſire you to lay aſide
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116000:100"/> prejudice, and conſider me as a Chriſtian in relation to the juſtice of the quarrell; as a Subject in relation to my Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Maſters commands; and as your Neighbour in relation to the many of your lives, I have preſerved in battell; and be not too raſh, but let me be judged by the Lawes of God, the Lawes of Nature, and Nations, and the Lawes of this Land; if you doe otherwiſe, I do hear appeal from you, to the Righteous judge of the world, who one day muſt be both your Judge and mine, and who alwayes gives Righteous Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he delivered with ſuch Gravitie, and without Paſſion as was much admired even of his enemies: After which, the Chancellour commanded the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be read, which he heard with a ſetled and an unmoved countenance, and deſiring to be futher heard, was preſently ſtopt by the Chancellour who commanded he ſhould be preſently removed back again to priſon, where being no ſooner come, but the Miniſters aſſault him afreſh, agravating the terrour of the Sentence, thereby to affright him; he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelf much beholding to the Parliament for the Honour they put upon him, ſaying; <hi>Hee took it for a greater honour to have his head ſtand upon the priſon Gate for this quarrell; than to have his picture in the Kings Bed-chamber. And (leſt his Loyaltie ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten) they had highly honoured him, in deſigning laſting monuments to four of the chiefeſt Cities, to bear up his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall to all poſteritie; wiſhing he had had fleſh enough, to have ſent a piece to every city in Chriſtendome to witneſſe his loyalty to his King and Countrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Friends were not ſuffered to come neer him, but a guard was alwayes in the Chamber with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he had neither time, nor place for his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotion, but in their hearing.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 21. Cloathed in a Scarlet cloak richly laced with Gold lace, he was brought to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116000:101"/> the Scaffold: He came along the ſtreets with ſo great ſtate, and there appeared in his countenance ſo much Beautie, Majeſtie and Gravitie, as amazed the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and many even of his Enemies did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the gallenteſt ſubject in the world: but becauſe all his Friends and well-willers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar'd from comming neer him; there was a boy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that purpoſe on the Scaffold who took his Laſt ſpeech, Which was to this Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am ſorry if this manner of my End be ſcandalous to any good Chriſtian. Doth it not often happen to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous according to the waies of the wicked, and to the wicked, according to the waies of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? doth not ſometime a juſt man periſh in his righteouſneſs, and a wicked man proſper in his malice? They who know me, ſhould not diſeſteem me for this; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater then I have been dealt with in this kind; yet I muſt not ſay but that all Gods Judgements are Juſt; For my private ſins, I acknowledge this to be Juſt with God, I ſubmit my ſelf to him: but in regard of man, I may ſay they are but inſtruments, God forgive them, I forgive them, they have oppreſſed the poor, and violently perverted Judgement and Juſtice, but he that is higher then they, will reward them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What I did in this Kingdome, was in obedience to the moſt juſt Commands of my Soveraign, For his defence in the day of his diſtreſſe, againſt thoſe that roſe up against him. I acknowledge nothing, but fear God and Honour the King, according to the commandements of God, and the Law of Nature, and Nations, and I have not ſinned againſt man, but againſt God; and with him there is Mercie, which is the ground of my drawing neer unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is objected againſt me by many, (even good People,) That I am under the Cenſure of the Church; This is not my fault, ſince it is only for doing my Dutit, by obeying my Princes moſt juſt Commands for Religion, His Sacred
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:116000:101"/> Perſon, and Authoritie. Yet I am ſorry they did Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate me; and in that, which is according to Gods Lawes; without wronging my conſcience or Allegeance I deſire to be relaxed; if they will not thus do it, I appeal to God who is the righteous Judge of the world, and who must, and will I hope be my Judge and Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſpoken of me, that I ſhould blame the King (God forbid,) For the late King, he lived a Saint, and died a Martyr; I pray God, I may ſo end as He did; If ever I would wiſh my ſoul in another mans ſtead, it ſhould be in his. For his Majeſtie now living, never people I believe might be more happy in a King: His Commands to me were moſt juſt; in nothing that he promiſeth will he fail. He deals juſtly with all men, I pray God he be ſo dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that he be not betrayed under truſt, as His Father was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deſire not to be miſtaken, as if my carriage at this time in Relation to your waies were ſtubborn; I doe but follow the Light of my own conſcience, which is ſeconded by the working of the Good Spirit of God that is within me, I thank him, I goe to Heavens throue with joy. If He enable me againſt the fear of Death, and furniſh me with courage, and confidence to embrace it even in its moſt ugly ſhape, Let God be glorified in my end, though it were in my damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet I ſay not this out of any fear or diſtruſt, but out of my duty to God, and Love to his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have no more to ſay, but that I deſire your Charity and Prayers. I ſhall pray for you all; I leave my Soul to God; my Service to my Prince: my Good will to my Friends; and my Name, and Charity to you all. And thus briefly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> have exonerated my Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being deſired to pray apart, He ſaid, <hi>I have already powred out my ſoule before the Lord who knows my heart, and into whoſe hands I have commended my Spirit, and he hath been graciouſly pleaſed to return to me a full aſſurance of peace in Jeſus Chriſt my Redeemer, And therefore if you will not Joyn with me in prayer; my reiterating again
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:116000:102"/> will be both Scandalous to you, and me.</hi> So cloſing his eyes, and holding up his hands, he ſtood a good ſpace at his inward devotions, being perceived to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly moved all the while; when he had done, he cal'd for the Executioner, and gave him money, then having brought unto him (hanging in a cord) his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and Hiſtorie, he hanged them about his neck; ſaying, <hi>Though it hath pleaſed. His Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie that now is, to make him one of the Knights of the moſt Honourable Order of the Garter; yet he did not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more Honoured by the Garter, than by that cord with the Books which he would embrace about his neck with as much joy and content, as ever he did the Garter, or a chain of gold,</hi> and therefore deſired them to be tied unto him as they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>When this was done, and his arms tied, he asked the Officers,
<hi>If they had any more Diſhonour, as they conceived it, to put upon him, he was ready to accept it.</hi> And ſo with an Undaunted Courage and Gravitie ſuffered, according to the Sentence paſt upon him.</p>
            <p>THe death of the noble Marqueſſe was not bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as a private loſſe, but rather as a publique ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie. The greateſt Princes in Europe expreſſed no ſmall ſorrow for his unhappy end. And indeed wee have not had in this latter Age a man of more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts either of body or of mind. He was a man not very tall, nor much exceeding a middle ſtature, but of exceeding ſtrong compoſition of body, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, with excellent proportion and feature; Dark brown hayr'd, ſanguine complexion, a ſwiſt and piercing gray eye, with a high noſe, ſomewhat like the antient ſigne of the Perſian Kings Magnanimitie. He was of a moſt reſolute and undaunted ſpirit, which began to appear in him, to the wonder and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men even in his childhood. Whom would it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:116000:102"/> not have ſtartled to attempt as he did at his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into <hi>Scotland,</hi> a journey wherein he could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt eſcape diſcovery, all paſſes being ſo layd for him, but even when he was known, and almoſt made publike, he proceeded in his intention? He was a man of a very Princely courage, and excellent addreſſes, which made him for the moſt part be us'd by all Princes with extraordinarie familiaritie; A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Horſeman, and had a ſingular grace in ryding, Nor is it leſſe wonderfull how in ſo great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of all things when warre in that Country is but tedious with the greateſt plentie it can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, he could patiently endure ſo much diſtreſſe. Nor is it leſſe to be wondred at, how he could win ſo much upon thoſe Iriſh, who had no tye to him either of Countrie, Language or Religion, as he did. More eſpecially when they wanted not all manner of temptation, that either their own miſeries and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable duty could ſuggeſt, or the wit and ſagacitie of the enemie could invent to make them leave him, and abandon the ſervice. Beſides the many examples ſhown upon them and their continuall want of Pay, either of which accidents in an Armie is ground enough, and has been many times the occaſion of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and deſertion. Nor had he only an excellent and mature judgement for providing and forecaſting of buſineſſe, but a prompt and readie ſpirit likewiſe in matters of preſent dange and ſudden caramitie, and theſe things which might have confuſed another mans underſtanding, as ſuch ſudden chances often doe, were a whetting to his wit. There are many ſtratagems in ſeverall Hiſtories related, which in the heat of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have been put in practice for the regaining of a day already loſt, or in danger to be ſo. As that of
<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurtha,</hi> a politick and valiant Prince, who in the heat of a battell betwixt him and <hi>Marius</hi> the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:116000:103"/> rode up and down in the head of the Armie, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bloudie ſword, and affirming that he had ſlain
<hi>Marius</hi> with his own hand, which word did ſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the
<hi>Numedians,</hi> and amaze the <hi>Romans</hi> that had not <hi>Marius</hi> in time appeared, that day had been in hazard. It is likewiſe reported of one of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Captains, that he flung his Standard amongſt the middle of the enemie, that his own ſouldiers by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward to reſcue it, might break and diſorder the enemie. Likewiſe of another that took the bridles off the horſe-heads, that every man might be alike vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and charge, as we ſay, without either fear or wit. But beyond all theſe in my opinion, was that device of the Marqueſſes, who at <hi>Alderne</hi> being in a great ſtrait, one wing of his Armie being routed, and the other in a very ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gering condition, he did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe that which was yet whole, with the feigned ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the other, that valiantly charged the enemie, and put the buſineſs again in an even ballance. And very like was it to that device of
<hi>Tullas Poſtilius,</hi> who being deſerted by <hi>Metius</hi> King of the <hi>Albans</hi> told his ſouldiers he had don't of purpoſe to try them, and by that means turn'd their fear into indignation, he was exceeding conſtant and affable to thoſe that did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him, and to thoſe he knew very affable, though his carriage which indeed was not ordinarie, did make him ſeem proud; Nor can his enemies lay any greater fault to his charge, than this inſatiable deſire of honour which he did purſue with as handſome and heroick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as ever any did, and ſuch as had neither admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of avarice or ſelf ends, though he was therewith by ſome moſt unworthily branded. For theſe and the like vertues of which he was the rich poſſeſſour, he was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented all Chriſtendome over, by all ſorts of men, and ſince his death too by thoſe who had the greateſt hand in't, though their ſucceſs at that time did animate their cruelty.</p>

            <head>The Speech of Collonel <hi>William Syb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> intended by him to have been ſpoken on the Scaffold at time of his Execution at
<hi>Edenborough, Jan.</hi> 7. 1650. but hearing that libertie would not be given him to ſpeak ſo freely, he gave a Copie of it to a ſpeciall friend,</head>
            <p>GEntlemen, I am brought this day to this place, to pay a debt to Nature before it be due: and by the malice and crueltie of my mercileſſe enemies, I am ſentenced to die as a Traytor to my Country, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to doe ſervice for my King, on whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and well-fare does depend the welfare of theſe Kingdoms; &amp; to whom I am bound both by the Law of God and man to perform all faithfull and loyall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And as the Cauſe for which I ſuffer proclames my loyaltie, ſo their Sentence does declare to all the world their diſloyaltie, and their intentions againſt their King.</p>
            <p>Their ſelf-guiltineſs makes cowardly ſpirits cruell; and ſuch was their proceedings againſt me, as that I could not obtain an Advocate to plead for me, nor any man skilfull in the Laws, either to adviſe with me, or to write my Defence, though they knew me to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Laws. Thus is my innocencie and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betrayed, partly by their malice, and my own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>The truth is, they did proffer to doe me any courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or favour, if I would make an ingenuous confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, accuſe ſome Noblemen and gentlemen of keeping correſpondencie with his Majeſtie, or with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe;</hi> which if I had done, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have been branded with perpetuall infamie, for I never knew any man in this Kingdome that did
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:116000:104"/> keep correſpondencie with them: neither had I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from his Majeſtie, or the Marqueſſe of
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> to treat with any. I did indeed ſpeak with ſome Noblemen and Gentlemen, becauſe I was formerly oblieged unto them for their love to me, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them ſome ſmall aſſiſtance to furniſh me in my journey; but I never ſpake with them concerning the publike Affairs, no further than the weekly <hi>Gazets</hi> made known to all the world; if theſe great Fiſh could have been taken in our Stateſmens Nets, it might have been that ſuch a Minim as I, ſhould have eſcaped the Bayliffe of the Fiſh-markets hand this day.</p>
            <p>I have been from my youth a Souldier; and though that Calling in it ſelf be honourable, yet men in that Calling have greater occaſions and provocations to ſinne than in any private Calling. Beſides naturally my youth led me to ſome abominable ſins, and cuſtome in them did for many years detain me captive unto them; ſo that I cannot but confeſſe that to me apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſhame and confuſion in this life, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul and body eternally in hell fire, if God ſhould deal with me according to my deſert; my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that the blood of my Saviour cries lowder in his ears for mercy, than my ſins doe for vengeance; and that he who hath promiſed a free pardon and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto all penitent ſinners through faith in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſus Chriſt, will purge &amp; cleanſe my ſoul from all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deliver me from all blood guiltineſs by the blood of his Son our Saviour. The true ſorrow that I find in my ſoul for my former ſins, and that godly reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and ſtedfaſt purpoſe I have to lead a new life if it pleaſe God to continue it, together with the joy, the patience, &amp; the courage I have to ſuffer, gives me ſome aſſurance of this bleſſed hope, that through faith in Chriſt Ieſus my Saviour, my penitent ſoul though ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:116000:104"/> And as for my religion, I die, as I lived, a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant; this Religion, I thank God, as it preſerved me from popiſh Superſtition, ſo it kept me from being ſeduced by the Novelties of the times, and from being deluded with the wicked doctrine which is now taught by the Reformers of the Kirk. It was this Religion which did keep my hand from your Covenant: of which in the ſpace of ſome five years you gave two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, quite contradictorie; for in the year 1639. the Aſſemblie did affirm (as appears by our Acts of Parliament and Aſſemblie) that in all Cauſes whatſoever you were to defend and maintain the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and dignitie of your King; but in the year 1644. you limit your abedience to your King, to your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Laws, and Libertie; and make your ſelves in all differences between the King and you, both Judge and Partie; the Religion in which I was bred, taught me to give both to God, and my King their due: it taught me to honour and worſhip God, and to expect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Chriſt; and to live ſoberly, and to deal juſtly with all men. I ever hated that Religion which made Saints or Angels ſharers with God his worſhip; or men partakers with my Redeemer in the work of my Redemption: or that made our Chriſtian libertie a cloak of maliciouſneſſe; and though naturally I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to evill, and wicked companie drew me to moſt hainous and filthy ſins; yet I thank God I hated that Religion that taught impietie and wickedneſs, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, murther, and injuſtice, or that approved the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Kings and their loyall Subjects for their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as having its originall rather from the Devill, who was a murtherer from the beginning, than from God; and I did ever eſteem it more agreeable to mans ſinfull and corrupted nature, than to Gods holy Word. I have heard a learned man ſay, that it were better to denie God to be; than to believe him to be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:116000:105"/> ſuch an one who delights in the bloody ſacrifices of men and women, or to think that he is ſuch an one who delights in crueltie and murther; the God whom we ſerve and worſhip, is the Saviour of the world, the preſerver of man, the Redeemer of Man-kind, the avenger of his blood. I have been taught from Gods word that he hath no pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall any evill dwell with him; undoubtedly ſuch bloody Sacrifices cannot be pleaſing or accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, for they are repugnant to his nature, and contradictorie to the juſtice and equitie of his holy Law.</p>
            <p>It is my greateſt grief at this time that I did not walk according to the puritie of my Religion, and the holineſs of God, who hath called us to the knowledge of his truth. Therefore let me entreat you to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God with me, and for me, that he would be pleaſed to pardon my many and great ſins; that he would purge my ſoul with the blood of his Son, from the guilt and pollution of all my ſins; that I may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto my heavenly Father without ſpot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, holy, without blemiſh; that he would receive me thorough the merits of my Saviour into everlaſting peace, and into the glorious eſtate of his choſen Saints in heaven. O Lord into thy hands I commend my ſoul; Lord Jeſu receive my ſpirit; O mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgive my Enemies, and lay not this ſin to their charge,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
